</div>

<p>It is not always an unmixed advantage to an elderly
critic of literature to be recognized as one of the Old
School who is interested in extremely modern and daring
young writers. But in the case of Harlan Cozad
McIntosh this reputation of mine has won me the greatest
and proudest pleasure a critic can have—the thrill of
being among the first to announce: “Here, anyway, is
genius!”</p>

<p>For from start to finish this extraordinary story holds
you under a spell—that is to say, if you are, as I am,
an obsessed devotee of the dangerous mole-runs of
beautiful and desperate human aberration. I have no
hesitation in saying that the character “Mr. Roberts” of
this book is a masterpiece of portraiture, and an almost
flawless presentation of one of those abnormal types of
men whose subterranean and half-suppressed feelings
lead to more tragedies than the ordinary reader of pathological
fiction would believe possible.</p>

<p>But daring and terrifying as Mr. McIntosh’s psychological
flashes of insight are, they by no means cover
the whole field of interest in this strange, and indeed I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
may boldly say, this unique book. There are passages of
the most exquisite beauty, beauty of that rare, intense,
evasive sort which, as the poet says, is like the lightning—vanished
ere you can say “It lightens!” There is, indeed,
in these poetic passages, so swift, so sudden, so
startling a beauty that it sweeps the reader away, causing
him to feel for a quick beat of time, as if he <em>were</em> the
author!</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from a doctrinaire treatise
on “the psychology of the abnormal” than this book. It
is an exciting love story of the most healthy, natural and
child-like simplicity; and that it is shot through and
through by the purple threads of abnormal pity and
terror enhances rather than lessens the tender freshness
of this ancient theme.</p>

<p>The book is a terrible tragedy, and one that certainly
in the fullest classical sense <em>purges our passions</em>; but
tragic though it is, it is the extreme opposite of anything
dispirited, dejected, disheartened or disillusioned.
A fine, pure, fierce detachment from anything cloying,
from anything voluptuously soft and sentimental, characterizes
this “ill-starred” and yet so proudly “well-starred”
young writer. The soul of the hero, obviously
a reflection of the author himself, moves through these
weird circles and ambiguous scenes, protected like Milton’s
lady in <cite>Comus</cite>, by the invisible guardians of a
most unusual and indeed almost unearthly chastity. The
moral of it all—if moral you want, and I am myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
old-fashioned enough <em>always</em> to want exactly that—is no
other than what we learn from Goethe as well as from
Milton: namely that <em>nothing</em>, however fascinating in its
provocative phosphorescence, can really contaminate a
soul “that has an instinct of the one true way.”</p>

<p>Men and women who make the pathetic mistake of
thinking themselves what is called “normal” ought all
to read this tragic tale, so that they shall be <em>shamed</em>, not
only into human sympathy, but into philosophical insight;
whereas those of us who make no such claim, and
are confessedly engaged in the hard struggle to get ourselves
into order, will find in Harlan McIntosh’s book
just what we have been seeking in vain: a stark, authentic,
unmitigated rendering of what it is like <em>really to be</em>
what these complacently detached investigators analyze
from so safe a distance! For myself, since I learnt
about M. de Charlus in Proust, I haven’t been so helped
in my understanding of these strange matters as when
destiny gave me the opportunity of passing my blind
fingers—for we are all blind in these cases—over the
mobile features of Mr. McIntosh’s extraordinary creations.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER I</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The sea’s reaches moved blue and green from the
western horizon to the Haitian coast. The small ship
<i>Verda</i> disturbed the roll of water.</p>

<p>Martin gave the ship a little right wheel and she had
her course, breaking the current. An offshore wind
brought the jungle to him. He closed his eyes and felt
its movement—the overcries of birds, animal musk and
the heavy heat of clouds. There, facing the sun, lay a
swan’s feather of beach shining up to the darker ridges.
Oceanward, the sea bent into the brightest corner.</p>

<p>It was after supper. He knew the sailors were lounging
on the poopdeck. Rio, naked to the waist, handsome,
with his broken chest and heavy shoulders, would be
telling the younger seamen of One Beer Annie and her
electric finger. Martin looked at the clock and at the
compass. He struck three bells and stepped away as his
relief entered the wheelhouse.</p>

<p>“Thirty-two,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Thirty-two,” repeated the quartermaster.</p>

<p>“Steering thirty-two,” called Martin to the mate on
the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The officer nodded his head.</p>

<p>Later, on lookout, Martin leaned against the ship’s
apron and watched the sky ring blue to blue. On the
coastal side the bright wing faded under the hills. Seaward,
the sun pressed into mist—sustained by color.
He shaded his eyes against the shrill line, saw it strike
the water, burn and recede. Catching the rim, it held
once and fell, breathing up softer lights. Flame, gold
and scarlet in procession shifted to turquoise and a
rolling mauve—slowly turning the crystal till darkness
caught one star.</p>

<p>The distant light trembled in his eyes. He crossed the
deck and faced the shore. An aluminum crust broke the
dark shoulder of mountain, rising higher till its bright
shale covered the swing of beach with moontide. Burning
from the painting ran the moonspindle, striking the
ship. Martin dropped his head and stared into the blue
foam.</p>

<p>Above him, Orion swung easily past the foremast and
returned; Polaris grew in the north; and behind him,
the Southern Cross lay on her side. He grabbed the
mainstay, pulled himself up on the apron and lay on his
back. His eyes followed the moon as she came toward
him, changing softly from flesh to white, round and white
like the abdomen of a woman.</p>

<p>Silence, dead and liquid, held the <i>Verda</i> from both
sky and sea. A restless mist, moving downward, obscured
the stars. On the land side heat-lightning followed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
sheaves. A thin black cloud raised the horizon. It built
higher and darker as it rushed at the ship.</p>

<p>Martin pulled off his skivy-shirt. The heat covered
his face with perspiration and he drew his arm across
his forehead. Isolated on the fo’c’sle head, away from
the ship and its crew, there was no proportion. The
wind dried his throat and he bent under the apron to
breathe, closing his eyes against the lightning. A wave
smashed on the bow and sounded through the forepeak.
He ducked lower under the steel cover and rubbed the
salt from his mouth. The rain struck. Falling solidly,
it hammered his back and shoulders until, at last, to
ease the pain, he turned his side against the pressure.
When he looked aft he knew that he was blind, seeing
neither mast nor running-lights. Living in this vacuum
of noise, without sight, he knelt on the deck with his
head in his arms and tried to breathe through the falling
water. Still and bowed he waited.</p>

<p>Abruptly the wind stopped, and the rain. He looked
up and saw the retreating clouds uncovering stars behind
him. The moon shone more brightly. The scent of
the jungle was deeper and the man with the sword in
the sky smiled as he swung past the mast. Martin stripped
off his dungarees and wrung the water from them. The
stiffening cloth was still moist when he pulled them on
again.</p>

<p>He was surprised toward the latter part of his watch
by a heavy, amused voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“Get your end wet?”</p>

<p>He saw Rio smiling at him.</p>

<p>“I did,” he replied gravely.</p>

<p>Rio slapped his hands together.</p>

<p>“Why’d you go to sea?”</p>

<p>Martin rubbed his chin and looked away.</p>

<p>“I’m getting along,” he answered.</p>

<p>Rio leaned on the rail beside him.</p>

<p>“A woman’s place is in the home.”</p>

<p>Martin felt himself beset by an out-of-time capriciousness.
Yet he knew these words, so like the emptying of
a fool’s wounds, were no more idle than the turn of
water and wind and all their purposes, though whistled
through a child’s melody. He knew also that certain
eccentricities of men, of winds, of waters, must be
directed and employed; therefore, without looking at his
friend, he spoke to him.</p>

<p>“The boundaries of the home have been extended.
The boundaries of your mind are arbitrary.”</p>

<p>“That serves me up, I guess.” Rio yawned. “But you
ain’t no seaman.”</p>

<p>Martin sighted over the rail.</p>

<p>“Scorpio’s tail light is out.”</p>

<p>Rio, persistent, glanced at him sideways.</p>

<p>“You ain’t happy here, and I am.” He breathed the
hot, moist wind and looked at the moon and the quiet
length under it. “I’m happy. This is the kind of night
I live for. It’s clean and hot. It burns the yellow out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
your blood. Some day,” he nodded toward the island
fading behind them, “I’m goin’ to get a little shack over
there with a shakedown roof, and maybe a small stove.”</p>

<p>“So you’re happy,” answered Martin. “Happy!” he
repeated in a louder voice. “That word doesn’t belong
on this deck.”</p>

<p>Rio grinned.</p>

<p>“You’re a Christian, then.”</p>

<p>Martin stepped closer to him.</p>

<p>“I believe I am.”</p>

<p>The lights of a ship came up on the port bow. Martin
crossed the deck and struck two bells. When he returned
he spoke abstractedly.</p>

<p>“I’d like to find a quiet beach myself. A beach that
walks with you in the daytime and sings with you at
night.... A place to rest.... But I can’t rest.”</p>

<p>Rio became confused. He put his hands on Martin’s
shoulders and for a second they stood motionless, like
mildewed lovers in a gloom proportionately obscure.
Then Rio whispered, “I’ll do my bit, my friend. I’ll take
your last illusion.”</p>

<p>Martin saw the fluid, hurt eyes and the bitter smile.
He struck Rio’s arms from his shoulders.</p>

<p>“How do you know that I still possess this ‘last
illusion?’ ... Why do you follow me?... You call
for the water and the heat. You’re part of the land we
passed and of your buccaneering ancestors. That doesn’t
include me. I’m a foreigner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Rio looked at him with hatred.</p>

<p>“Meanin’, my fine lad, I ain’t part of you? Well,
maybe I ain’t.” He brought one fist down on the rail,
then pointed at the water. “Christ, you’re wrong about
it all, though. You ain’t no sailor—but you <em>are</em> the
‘part of.’ I’m the foreigner. My father buccaneered from
the pulpit. A hard-shell, hell-fire Baptist, he cheapened
a pirate’s trade with pennies out of a palm leaf....
I remember him well; a dirty man from the west, with
green eyes and a thin beard. He showed me your English
and your habits and shouted his bad theology. And all
the time, my native mother, with the sound of the beach
for religion, stared at him——” He turned clumsily,
more like an anthropoid than a man. “I don’t get myself,
Martin. Maybe I’m starved. It’s been a long time.
I’ve lived in a monastery since a brown girl——”</p>

<p>“I hear every word,” said Martin. “I hear ‘monastery,’
‘brown girl,’ ‘pirate’—but I can’t put them together. I
can’t think logically. They’re disconnected pictures.”</p>

<p>“Keep your pictures.” Rio moved closer. “I said I’m
crazy to-night.”</p>

<p>Now Martin could see an intentional grace, eager and
sharp.</p>

<p>“Hold your Baptist’s head then, Rio. That’s not for
us.” Martin’s waist was slim in the moonlight. He knew
the night was wrong—something to fight or there would
be a mistake. He turned away. “It’s nearly eight bells,
Rio, and the squarehead relieves me too fast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>Rio held his fist against the moon. His face seemed
breaking.</p>

<p>“You ain’t right, Martin, but you make me think you
are.”</p>

<p>He climbed down the ladder, walked across the foredeck
and aft to his bunk. He took his bath in a bucket,
put on clean skivies, turned in and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>On lookout, Martin watched dew form on the steel
rail and rubbed his hand across it. The sun had burned
his hair lighter than his skin; and as the moist wind
pushed it from his temples, a smile, restrained by the
unfathomable hurt of one who, for escape, has taken
to the sea, formed on his lips. That he could dream
well could be told by the changing color of his eyes
according to that which was about him; and by the
fact or the illusion that he saw great distances or none
at all. His conversation with Rio had been a short but a
disturbing one. At the climactic moment it had seemed
obvious. Not now; and deliberately Martin turned his
thoughts to the ocean. His union with the ship and all
that was about him was brief and precisioned. Perhaps
it was his quietness or perhaps a quality in the sky;
but his silent figure was adjusted in the small cosmos.
His eyes, indecisive of both moon and ocean, had found
the properties of each. Thus, filled with iron and dull
gold, he wore the uniform and restlessness of the tides
and knew that although his own desire had been encompassed,
it had not been lost. He pressed against the rail,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
his arms braced, his bronze hair damp against the deeper
bronze of his skin. Through the clarity of a sudden,
stern compassion, he swung around to where Rio had
stood. In the recurring consciousness of the presence of
his friend, he drew the solemn colors about them. Against
his feet the steel plates trembled with the ship’s engines.
The wind changed. A thousand mirrors broke under the
high moon.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER II</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin looked around the fo’c’sle, swung open
the locker door to see if he had packed all his gear and
looked under the blankets on his bunk.</p>

<p>“So long, boys,” he said. “I’m shoving off.”</p>

<p>The seamen at the card table and those lying in their
bunks glanced up from newspapers and cigarettes.</p>

<p>“So long, Mart—So long. Take it easy.”</p>

<p>He pulled his duffel-bag over his shoulder and walked
up the ladder to the afterdeck. Languorous winds and the
dark waters of streaming nights lurked in the corners
of the bulkheads. Yet the knowledge of his late intimacy
with these secrets had no quality of nostalgia for him.
He was surprised at the indifference he felt on leaving
the ship, all the more so because he had no reason for
this coldness.</p>

<p>The chief mate saw him standing by the rail. He had
often wondered about Martin—that strange sailor who
had gone about his duties so quietly. That was part of
it. He was so damned quiet. No wonder the other sailors
hadn’t liked that. He did his work well and was the best
helmsman on the ship; but off watch, he had the air of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
a man looking for the unnecessary. He avoided the
sailors with such instinctive thoroughness that it was
obvious even to them that he intended no offense. It was
more, thought the mate, as if he seemed to be thinking
a great deal and never getting anywhere with it. Frequently,
on sultry nights, when the mate couldn’t sleep
and had taken a turn around the ’midship deck, he’d
seen Martin sitting alone on the afterhatch looking at
the sky. The officer had a few books on psychology which
he read instead of fiction; and therefore felt himself
pretty well up on the distressed mind. He was a kind-hearted
man, and one night he’d called Martin into his
cabin to “sort of decide what made him tick,” as he
said afterwards. What was it Martin had said?...
Something about the sea being a fine girl for a man,
or some such rot; and said quite pleasantly. And when
the mate had pulled him round to psychology, Martin
had agreed with him that it was a nice vehicle for a
malingering neurasthenic.... No—damn it!—the
fellow had said that first, himself! It was easy to see the
chap had read a bit. He addressed the mate’s most ponderous
terms with earnestness; but always he’d wound
up in a theoretical mess that half sounded like a laugh.
Still, one couldn’t get upset over something that wasn’t
there; and certainly there was no laughter in Martin’s
expression. The mate was sure of it. It was a damned
odd feeling though, to have him sitting there looking at
you patiently with that peculiar, absent manner. He’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
told Martin that it was best for the sailors to get along
together and to yarn a bit and get things off their chests.
And then the queerest thing happened. Martin had told
him that good-fellowship was not only essential, but unavoidable;
and from there on, he’d continued to speak
in English; only what he was saying didn’t make sense.
It was like dumping words into a pot and shoveling
them around with your finger. By God!—it was a strange
feeling listening to that! And then Martin had gone....
Just the same, when the mate saw him with his duffel-bag
beside him, looking out at the bulk of the city, it made
him feel funny—sort of lonely for him. And he went
over.</p>

<p>“New York in the winter is no place for a sailor,
Martin, and you’re paying off with very little.”</p>

<p>“I know.” He leaned toward the officer and spoke in a
low voice. “I know. But there’s something important to
be found out, Mister. Important to myself, yes—and to
you, and perhaps to more than both of us.” He pointed
beyond the warehouses to the pinnacles of the city.
“That old line won’t stay. But there’s a basic pattern
under it that will remain. That ought to be known.
Damn it, Mister, I won’t find it nor, perhaps, my son,
but if we keep looking—” He picked up his bag.</p>

<p>Infinitely puzzled, the mate looked after him.</p>

<p>“That’s that,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>Martin went down the gangplank and, without turning,
started for the city. He took the elevated to Chatham<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Square where he got off and asked a policeman for an
address. The shock of change from the cleanliness and
solitude of the ocean to this polyglot of grime and faces
was physical; and he tightened up his nerves as though
preparing for an explosion. A few minutes later he
walked into Relief Headquarters, a rusty, high-walled
building in the center of the Bowery. Policemen watched
the group of applicants carefully. There were two lines
of men, one set apart for seamen. Martin joined this
group, noticing how strangely the sailors, tanned, alert
and swaggering, contrasted with the white-faced, hopeless
habitués. When his turn came a clerk, tired, frowning,
looked up from his desk.</p>

<p>“Name?”</p>

<p>“Devaud.”</p>

<p>“De what?”</p>

<p>“Devaud,” answered Martin. “Vaud, as in vaudeville.”</p>

<p>“Age?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight.”</p>

<p>“Go to that desk.” Aside, the man called to a case-worker.
“Mr. Stein, here’s another for you.”</p>

<p>Martin went over and stood patiently in front of Mr.
Stein who was fumbling with some papers. Stein had
short-cropped gray hair which grew halfway down his
forehead. It made Martin think of a Polynesian thatched
hut. Stein’s chin sloped backward so abruptly that he
appeared more like a primitive man than one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
present. Only his fat lips and stomach were mellowed
and sweetened by whisky and a rapidly departing
youth.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said. Then, smiling so that he showed
a large area of widely separated teeth, he slowly drew
in his smile and ended by regarding Martin almost
beseechingly. “Sit down,” he said again, folding his
hands over his fat stomach. “We like to understand, to
get closer to our more unfortunate brothers. We are here
to help you adjust yourself. We hope to provide you
with every facility for rehabilitation.”</p>

<p>Martin felt a momentary irritation.</p>

<p>“Rehabilitation from what?” he asked, wondering
what this empiric monstrosity was conspiring.</p>

<p>“Rehabilitation from—” Stein hesitated. He looked
at Martin’s dungarees. “Are you planning on returning
to the sea?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The case-worker took his pencil.</p>

<p>“I’m sure we can help you.” He smiled again and
nodded encouragingly. “It will be all right. Just sketch
your history briefly.” He slipped back into his chair,
setting the flat convolutions of his brain at a receptive
curve.</p>

<p>Martin reflected on his “history.” The walls of this
dirty place fell apart and memories came up in a flood....
His father—a story of the one professor, deathless
in his circumference of knowledge; a man affectionate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
yet untenable within the world, struck close in the
mystery of his students; humble with his virtues, out of
cognizance, and strong in the strength of those he guided,
he lived apart and yet among the compasses of his direction....
His mother, carrying an exotic, foreign
beauty into time as though indignant with maturities....
His white child-wife, her white child-fingers screaming
on the piano against his inevitable demands....
Her death.... Then ships and oceans and the lust of
palms....</p>

<p>“Your history!” Stein’s sharp voice, bringing back the
sharper walls and the honesty of where he was, demanded
laughter. And Martin laughed until each memory
was dead.</p>

<p>“My history?” he asked, wiping his eyes. “You
wouldn’t like my history. It isn’t interesting enough.
Case-historians would starve to death with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stein sat up straight. He frowned and looked at
his hands.</p>

<p>“Very amusing.” He filled two forms rapidly. “This,”
he said, handing Martin one of them, “provides you with
a hotel room for the duration of two weeks. And this,”
he continued, “allows you meal tickets at any of our
restaurants to the value of forty cents per day for the
same length of time.”</p>

<p>Outside, Martin shook his head to free it from the
mustiness of dismissed progressions and the impurity of
this newer living. He glanced at one of the tickets.
“<span class="allsmcap">HOTEL PINE LEAF, RESERVED ESPECIALLY FOR SEAMEN</span>,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
he read. As he walked on toward the hotel he was
stopped twice for a cigarette. One heavy-jawed fellow
tried to strike up a conversation and offered to help him
with his bag, all the time walking uncomfortably close to
him. Martin shook his head and the man dropped behind,
muttering.</p>

<p>The lobby of the Pine Leaf was one floor up. A man
seated in one of the chairs which lined the walls, was
snoring loudly. “He must be sick,” thought Martin, for
no one disturbed him. Martin leaned his bag near the
desk and as he did so, a bull-necked sailor, his collar
open, ran at him.</p>

<p>“Good God!” said the man. “We’ve grounded. Damn
you, Captain! Keep her in the channel.” He held his fist
menacingly.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Martin, stopping stock-still. “And
now, look to your engines.”</p>

<p>The clerk behind the wire netting regarded them
worriedly.</p>

<p>“Go back to your cabin, Danny,” he said. “We’ve
taken on the pilot.”</p>

<p>Danny, shaking all over, looked once more at Martin
and returned to his chair.</p>

<p>Martin handed his slip to the clerk who turned it
nervously in his hand.</p>

<p>“Danny’s all right,” he said. “Liquor took his ticket.
He never jumped like that before, though. Kind of look
out, will you?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t mean anything.” Martin smiled reassuringly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
“I jumped like that once myself.” He took his key
and towel, packed his canvas up three flights of stairs
and walked down the corridor to his room. It was a narrow,
cell-like cubicle, furnished with a cot and a small
locker. There was no light and the tiny window, high in
the wall, admitted only a few indirect rays of sunshine.
Martin sorted his gear, found his razor and went into the
washroom.</p>

<p>Three men were huddled in a corner. As Martin lathered
his face he looked in their direction and saw that
they had a bottle of rubbing alcohol which they were
diluting with warm water. After a good deal of grunting
and shaking and laughing they held it to the light.</p>

<p>“Looks to me like Tri Gin,” said one whose hands
shook violently.</p>

<p>“Looks to me like smoke,” said another, laughing and
turning to Martin. “Have some smoke, Jack?” he asked.</p>

<p>Martin shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ulcers,” he said, pointing to his stomach, and started
shaving.</p>

<p>The men shook their heads sympathetically. This, they
understood. They were dancing to the clapping of hands
when Martin left.</p>

<p>In the low glim of his room he changed his shirt. He
was about to lock his door when a lad ran frantically
down the narrow hall, bumping into him. Martin held the
boy coldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“Hide me,” sobbed the lad. “It’s Danny. He’s had
smoke—” the sobs continued. “Danny thinks ... for
Christ’s sake!—hide me!”</p>

<p>Martin shoved the boy inside his little room and closed
the door, then took a cigarette from his pocket. A moment
later, Danny put his head around the shadowy
corner and walked slowly toward him. When he was
closer, Martin struck a match and lit his cigarette abstractedly.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Danny in a hard whisper.
“Where’s my little galley rat?”</p>

<p>“Speak American, buddy,” said Martin. “This is an
American vessel—not a Limey.”</p>

<p>“Don’t lie to me, you damned school-ship!” cried
Danny, coming forward. “Where is he?”</p>

<p>Martin sighed resignedly.</p>

<p>“He’s here, Danny—under my shirt. Come get him.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That’s better. I’m coming, friend.”</p>

<p>He walked up close to Martin who dropped his cigarette.
Danny shot out his right hand and grabbed Martin’s
shoulder; but feeling the broad, tensed muscle, he
became suddenly quiet and stood for a long time running
his hand up and down Martin’s arm. At last, he started
to cry gently. Then, and only then, did Martin throw his
arm about him and whisper all the lonely, desperate
things that sailors know; until willingly, Danny let himself
be led into his own room. Martin got down on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
knees and took off Danny’s shoes. He covered him with
a blanket, looked at him once to be sure he was sleeping
and tiptoed out.</p>

<p>When he got back to his own room the boy was gone.
So were his small camera and his pea-jacket.</p>

<p>He went out into the street and walked along until he
saw a beer sign. He stood at the rail and kicked the sawdust
angrily, thinking of his camera. As he took his glass
he caught his reflection in the large mirror above the bar
and burst out laughing; for his head seemingly rested
between the enormous breasts of a nude which had been
painted on the wall behind him. Amazed at this unsuspected
liaison, he turned to regard with favor the immense
mural. The lady reclined, supine and indifferent
to the ardent glances of the drunken men about her. Her
bottom rested on a couch of lurid green and one arm,
disproportionate, held aloft a wreath of garden spray
and roses.</p>

<p>Martin was still laughing when a little white-haired
man with a thick nose and red eyes walked over to him.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, sailor,” said the little fellow, and blew two
sharp notes between his teeth. “Ship ahoy!”</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy,” said Martin.</p>

<p>The little man giggled.</p>

<p>“I like you, mate.” He held out his hand, his eyes
watering happily. “I’m a sailor, and my name’s Old
Crackin. When my old lady’s sick—when she’s havin’
babies—<em>I</em> don’t take no tea for the fever. <em>I</em> don’t wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>He turned and pointed to the mural. “I git mine from
<em>her</em>.” His eyes dimmed in affection as he stared at the
naked lady. Then he smiled again at Martin. “I can spell
too, mate,” he added proudly.</p>

<p>“Spell CAT,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“K-R-Double T,” said the old seaman, an ecstatic glow
on his face.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” observed Martin, in a tone of approbation.
“Can you spell DOG?”</p>

<p>“Sure I can!” Old Crackin answered promptly, looking
as if he could scarcely contain himself for joy.
“G-R-Double D,” he recited, and held out his hand once
more.</p>

<p>Martin saw the running sores between the old sailor’s
fingers. He smiled at him, called the bartender, asked
for a beer and paid for it.</p>

<p>“Drink up,” he said and left.</p>

<p>The little man looked at his beer and drank it slowly,
bitterness and necessity in his expression.</p>

<p>The nearest Relief restaurant was at the far end of
the Bowery. Martin walked along, sticking to the edge of
the sidewalk, glad that his dungarees were clean. The
horizons of the sea outlined the figures of the people
about him. They moved down the street, slack-mouthed,
too tired to be desperate. Martin saw them as an old
river, full of eddies and currents—muddy, yet retaining
the purity of utter despondency.</p>

<p>In a doorway, out of the late afternoon sun, a man lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
sleeping as though drugged. And at one corner three
men were drinking openly from a bottle while a policeman
passed them without interest. A long-haired, wild-eyed
fanatic, his shirtfront covered with dark stains, addressed
an amused group of loafers on their sins, vividly
painting the atrocious hells that awaited them, and turning
only to spit at the passing cars. Whenever there was
a momentary lull of traffic he would spit on his own thin
coat-tails in his excess of hatred. This brought the most
hilarious laughter from the crowd. A thick-set drunken
woman with one stocking dragging the pavement brought
the preacher’s fury to such a height that he rushed at her,
his mouth wide open. She swung at him sluggishly, missing
his chin by a narrow margin; whereupon he ran
around her in ever-widening circles as she continued her
forward movement in dignified arabesques.</p>

<p>Martin walked on more slowly, attempting to find a
stronger sedative with each horror he passed. A man lay
stretched across the sidewalk. His mouth was bleeding,
his trousers were open and a slow trickle of urine ran
down to the curb. The crowd, apparently oblivious,
walked around him and continued down the street. In his
rising emotion, Martin nearly stopped. He wanted to
cover and protect the man—wanted to carry him to some
safe doorstep. But his hesitation was brief; for he knew
that this was the accustomed vagary in a clouded, forgotten
street—knew that he would be jailed or put to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
trial as a mischief-maker or a madman if he tried to
block the immutable routine of such a land. And so he
went on to the restaurant with his heart completely hypnotized
because, alive, it could not bear the awareness of
such a state.</p>

<p>Noise and confusion were in the cafeteria. A line of
men moved slowly past the counter, carrying their trays
and pointing to the food they wanted.</p>

<p>Martin picked up a tray, shook off the greasy drops
and looked at the signs. They read:</p>

<table summary="Menu">
  <tr>
    <td>BREAST OF LAMB!</td>
    <td>FIFTEEN CENTS.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HAM AND BEANS!</td>
    <td>FIFTEEN CENTS.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>EGG!</td>
    <td>FIVE CENTS.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“Ham and beans!” he shouted against the noise of
rattling plates and cups.</p>

<p>The boy behind the counter ladled out a large plate of
beans, dropping a slice of boiled ham upon them.</p>

<p>“Milk,” yelled Martin.</p>

<p>He carried his tray to a vacancy on the long, marble-slabbed
table.</p>

<p>An old man, bent, unshaven, was scavenging the plates
for food that others had left. Martin reached in his
pocket for a meal ticket. A boy sitting nearby pulled at
his elbow to stop him.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a sucker,” he said. “It’s the old guy’s
racket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>Martin handed the ticket to the old man. He felt irritable
as he sat down next to the boy.</p>

<p>“He can take it, and to hell with him,” he said.</p>

<p>The boy laughed.</p>

<p>“I felt like that when I paid off. Now, I’m Red, the
Cockroach—and a tighter one you’ll never find in the
galley sink!” He talked on rapidly, going from one subject
to another and his freckled nose was so impudent
that Martin had to smile with him. At last, the boy
pulled off his cap, showing his dark red hair. “That’s
why they call me ‘Red.’ And,” he continued, putting his
hand in his pocket and pulling out a fistful of tickets,
“that’s why I’m ‘Red, the Cockroach.’ How’s shipping?”</p>

<p>“I’m not trying to get out,” Martin replied. “No
butter?” he added, looking at the stale, brownish bread.</p>

<p>“No butter,” answered the boy, nodding his head.
“And watch the beans. See those black fellows?” He
pointed to Martin’s plate. “They’ll come up.”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave them,” said Martin, running his fork
through the pinkish mixture.</p>

<p>The boy had thrown his cap on the floor. He picked it
up with a nervous gesture and got out of his chair.</p>

<p>“I’m going for a stick of weed,” he said. “Do you
want to blow one up with me?”</p>

<p>Martin shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m a drinker,” he said. “I’ll put a beer behind yours
if you care for it. I’m not hungry enough yet to manage
this.” He stood up, pushing his plate to one side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a hell of a racket,” said Red, as they walked out
together. “They make plenty on this garbage.”</p>

<p>It had grown dark. Under a streetlamp, Red looked
sideways at Martin.</p>

<p>“My connection is around the corner,” he said. “It’s
Chilean Hay—good stuff.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Martin. “I’m a drinker. I don’t object to
Marihuana, but it depresses me; gives me bum kicks,
you know.”</p>

<p>The boy shrugged.</p>

<p>“O.K.,” he said. “There’s my connection.” He nodded
to a man watching them from a doorway.</p>

<p>The fellow met them and looked suspiciously at Martin.</p>

<p>“It’s O.K.,” said Martin’s friend. He took two cigarettes
and handed back a quarter.</p>

<p>“I’m hot,” said the fellow, and walked away.</p>

<p>“He’s right,” said Red. “The law has his number.
They know he’s peddling.”</p>

<p>“That makes it nice for us.” Martin glanced cautiously
around him.</p>

<p>“We’re O.K. The law don’t bother the consumer.
Here!” Red pointed to a dimly-lighted alley. “We can
blast it right here.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather open?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said the boy. He lit a cigarette, puffed
on it and held the smoke in his lungs. Talking jerkily, he
let out the smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“There’s just two kinds of men in the Bowery,” he
said. “Weed-heads like me, and they’re smart. And lushhounds—”
he stopped talking.</p>

<p>“Like me?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>Red took several more puffs from the cigarette, jigging
on his heels.</p>

<p>“There it is,” he said. “I got it.” He laughed uncertainly.
“Come over to the Square with me. I know where
we can make a couple of bucks.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Martin before he thought.</p>

<p>“Hustling,” answered Red.</p>

<p>“Hustling what?” insisted Martin, already in.</p>

<p>“Anything from gin to Jesus,” said the boy dreamily.
“Or in a pinch, an Old Auntie.”</p>

<p>“No. I’m turning in.” Martin felt suddenly tired.</p>

<p>Around the corner, Red faced him.</p>

<p>“It’s as soft as roses,” he said. “Just as soft as roses.”
He walked to the curb, peered over the edge, and stepped
carefully across the street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER III</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The <i>Verda</i>, due to sail the following day, lay in
port. Her lines were coiled and her deck chipped. The
houses had been cleaned and the captain’s deck and the
bridge were freshly painted. She was neat and lonely,
pushing against the wharf with tired swells. She was not
the same ship that had smashed against a storm-driven
wave with a ferocity equaling that of the ocean, or had
tolled deftly under the charge of a freak sea. She was
aloof, nearly desperate amid the deluge of cans and
boxes and other flotsam that swept the harbor. She was
a dead creature, with the look of a coffin about her; and
all the ships alongside were the same.</p>

<p>Below, in the <i>Verda</i>, the sailors were busy in the washroom.
Tired by a day in the holds they opened some
beer. A young ordinary seaman, restrained by weeks at
sea, jumped around the room noisily and popped a towel
at one of the men.</p>

<p>“Pipe down!” someone yelled at him.</p>

<p>The boy, unlistening, wrapped a towel around his
waist, grabbed another, put on wooden sandals and ran
into the fo’c’sle. Rio was sitting on his bunk, his chin in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
his hands, staring straight before him. Exhilarated by
the beer and the cold bath, the ordinary danced forward
and snapped the towel, flicking it against Rio’s cheek.
Instinctively, the big sailor jumped to the boy’s side, his
fingers spread. The ordinary turned pale and backed
away. At this, Rio’s eyes cleared. He regarded the lad
as though seeing him for the first time and without a
word, returned to his bunk. The ordinary took one more
frightened look at him, went back to the washroom and
was soon laughing again.</p>

<p>In the fo’c’sle Rio was silent. The other sailors began
to drift in, but no one spoke to him. He sat on his bunk
with his chin in his hands, thinking about Martin. He
remembered the night on lookout, the ship’s foam and
the low constellations. He remembered lights over Haiti
and a young, impulsive face. Martin hadn’t understood.
He knew what his friend had thought. By God!—he’d
thought it himself for a minute or two.... Why had
Martin got off in New York at this season? It would soon
be winter. He didn’t have any money. His body was conditioned
to the tropics. His clothes were light and his
blood thin. He would sleep in a flop house, eat bad food
and get sick from that cold east wind.</p>

<p>Rio got up from his bunk and went to his locker. He
put on a new suit and new shoes. He packed his gear
except for his sea boots and oilskins. These he laid on
a bench. Then he put on his overcoat and a new hat,
picked up his bag and walked out of the fo’c’sle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>None of the sailors had said anything while he packed.
But when he had gone, the young ordinary looked around
with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“For gosh sake!” he said. “What’s he doin’?”</p>

<p>No one answered him. An old sailor picked up Rio’s
sea boots and inspected them.</p>

<p>“There’s a god-damned hole,” he said.</p>

<p>An able-bodied seaman lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“He blew his cork,” he said to the smoke.</p>

<p>“It’s his own cork,” answered the old sailor.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said the A.B., picking up Rio’s oilskins and
hanging them by his own locker.</p>

<p>“Let’s get a game,” suggested the ordinary, shuffling a
pack of cards.</p>

<p>“Get your game with the black gang,” said the old
sailor. “Them lights’re goin’ out.”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” said the A.B., pulling on a blue jacket.
“There’s a bag on Sand Street that thinks I’m papa.”</p>

<p>The ordinary stopped him.</p>

<p>“Loan me a dollar, Al. An’ I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>The A.B. laughed.</p>

<p>“A dollar?” He laughed again without looking.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you back in Panama,” said the ordinary.</p>

<p>“We don’t get no draw in Panama,” said Al, and left.</p>

<p>Some of the men followed him and the others climbed
into their bunks. The lights went out. The old sailor
snored uneasily through the bitter ghosts of his life. In
the bunk above him the young ordinary tried to forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Sand Street. He wanted to think about a secluded little
valley on the Pacific coast—so far away. He remembered
the thick smell of clover and the believing, fresh eyes of
a girl he had left—for this? His bunk felt damp and he
turned wearily.... His shipmate was on Sand Street
now. There would be light-haired women and dark-haired
women. There would be dancing and an orchestra....
The boy rolled on his stomach and held a
pillow tightly against his eyes. The darkness brought
fields and sunsets; branches and yellow, curving rivers.
Memory covered Sand Street—Sand Street with its gin-mills,
its red mouth and perspiration. The boy held the
pillow tighter. Smelling the girl’s lips and the clover—dreaming
of the bright, soft land—so far—his mother,
his sweetheart, he went to sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER IV</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin had lived in the Bowery a week before he
realized that the sounds and odors seemed less offensive
to him; that his acquaintances and his surroundings appeared
less brutal. Each night in the hotel some man
died loudly in his bed. It was an incident. Martin felt
himself in a husk through which no poison could penetrate.
One day, in an effort to regain his lost perception
he left the street, crossed old Italian town, passed barren,
rock-like buildings and looked for the first time at Washington
Square. He walked across the park, holding it
all—the grassy air, the fat babies, the old men with
tanned, bald heads and individualities he’d never seen
before nor understood. On one bench he saw several of
his comrades on Relief. They were sitting quietly in the
warm, fall sunshine. “Talked out,” thought Martin, “and
glad of it.” He passed them, nodded, smiled and wondered
why they thought him so apart, youthfully looking
at them for an answer instead of at himself. He then
crossed over to the circular pool in the center of the
Square where boys and girls were romping in the thin
spray of the fountain. In the anticipation of the approaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
colder weather when the water would be
stopped and this late play ended for a time, they seemed
more active than usual. “Why is it,” Martin asked himself,
“that I feel kinship among the antitheses—these gay
children or the devil!”</p>

<p>One child, like all the others but for thinner legs and
an abundance of pale freckles, looked up at him and
asked if he would watch her shoes and stockings while
she waded. This responsibility was heartening; and he
sat down on the edge of the pool while she went in rather
cautiously. The child seemed even more fragile among
the vigorous ones who were shoving each other and kicking
up the water. For a long time Martin watched her.
“She might have been my own little daughter,” he said
aloud at last; and immediately the mist seemed to fall
more heavily from the fountain and the play to become
more violent until he wished it over with. The thought of
home—a child—serenities attendant, brought the conflicting
inquiries of his life more sharply before him and
he brooded. A few drops of cold water in his face stopped
the course of these reflections and he looked up frowning,
his eyebrows raised. It was the little girl. She was laughing
at his discomposure.</p>

<p>“You looked funny,” she said.</p>

<p>“Did I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s why I threw the water. You looked cross.
Did I keep you too long?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he answered, smiling at her. “You know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
quite well that wasn’t it at all. Furthermore, I shouldn’t
be astonished if you <em>did</em> know, right now, why I was
cranky.”</p>

<p>This amused her again.</p>

<p>“You’re the funniest person I ever knew,” she said.
“You talk like a teacher.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a teacher; I’m a pupil,” Martin replied. “And
I’m funny because I study funny things.”</p>

<p>“What kind of funny things?” asked the child, looking
excited.</p>

<p>“Many things. I study lady tigers that take off their
stripes every night and put them on in the morning quite
differently and——”</p>

<p>“Why do they do that?” interrupted the girl.</p>

<p>“So they will be in style,” he continued seriously.
“And I study dentist birds that repair alligators’ teeth;
and mice that fly upside down.”</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed the girl somewhat indignantly, “I
never heard such stories in my life!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t half,” said Martin. “Be very quiet now.
Don’t move. Do you see that fly that lit on my knee? He’s
looking for something to eat. There. He’s found it.
Maybe I spilled sugar on my pants this morning. But do
you see what he’s doing before he eats? He’s washing his
face with his forelegs.”</p>

<p>The little girl watched carefully and saw the insect
dip its head and bring its arms across its face like a
brush. Suddenly she waved at it and the fly spun away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t stand them,” she said.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” Martin nodded, “it washed its face.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t as funny as the tiger,” the girl concluded.
“Tell me how a tiger can take off its stripes. Does it
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Of course not.” Martin stood up. “I have to go now.”</p>

<p>The little girl put on her shoes.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d come again to-morrow. If you do, I’ll
bring my ball.”</p>

<p>“That will be fun,” called Martin as he walked away.
Going back to his hotel he thought of this blue-eyed
youngster and how great it would be to tell her fairy
tales every night and buy her sandals and her frocks. And
with this picture came once more the vision of all the
rest of it—a wife’s head on his shoulder, a fireplace, and
yes—a pipe. He wondered then where in the world a
finer shadow was leading him—a search for mysteries
without substance or reason. At that moment he was a
tired and a lonely man, quite willing to exchange a pound
of mysticism and ideals, hard-won from depth to depth,
for one ounce of level complacency. But after the first
bitterness had worn off he was the same desperate young
lover of the physiostatic tides of force that subtly pull
and push until out of sheer pity they permit the frail
skeleton to slip up on the sands of its desire where the
hollow star, so followed, lies desolate and discontent.</p>

<p>The next day he was glad to see the child again. Her
good humor freed him—was pure liberation from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
constriction of the Bowery. She called out to him at once.</p>

<p>“Hello, teacher.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you said ‘Martin.’”</p>

<p>“Is that your first name?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t mind if I call you that?”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said deliberately, “my name is Alice.”</p>

<p>“A pretty name.” Martin appeared abstracted.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it. But I can’t help it. I’d rather be called
‘Betty.’” She held out her hand. “Here’s my ball. Let’s
play by the Arch.”</p>

<p>They bounced it back and forth until Alice was tired.</p>

<p>“You can’t throw it on top,” she declared, sitting
down on the curb.</p>

<p>Martin examined the light and badly worn tennis ball
and measured the distance to the top of the great Arch.</p>

<p>“You’re probably right,” he agreed. But he gave a
mighty heave and the ball just rolled over the edge
where it remained. This amused Alice; but Martin was
annoyed. He stood looking up at the top ledge of the
Arch for several minutes. At last, however, he said,
“Come along,” for he remembered a drug store near by
in which he had seen some tennis racquets.</p>

<p>A policeman had been watching them play ball and
Martin thought the observation had been casual; but
when they made ready to leave the park the suspicion on
the man’s face had become so obvious that it brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Martin up with a start. From surprise, he changed to
anger; and when they passed the patrolman he stared
with such fury at the officer that Alice questioned him.
Martin did not answer her, but talked on rapidly about
the tennis ball. Then he began to reconsider the situation.
It was true that the policeman had been justified.
This was New York—a thick, practical city with an
imperative demand for the protection of its children.
Martin’s anger abated; and when he and Alice reached
the drug store he deliberately put an end to his thoughts
and premonitions and bought her a fine, new ball. The
matter-of-fact way she took it pleased him more than
any thanks she could have given him; for it meant he was
accepted as a friend.</p>

<p>The little girl insisted that he return to the park next
day, explaining that he should use her present first. And
when she went dancing away, Martin smiled so broadly
that the intense, deft lines of his face were strangely
softened. This mood remained until he reached the
Bowery, but in his room was completely lost in its solitude.
Apprehension for his friendship for this child
turned the channels of his mind toward new rivulets,
each more forbidding than its predecessor, until he
realized there was no oasis of sweetness in the barrens of
his choosing. His temporary home, his very style and
itinerant manner of living were contributory fences to the
land beyond the streets—a land he felt he had invaded.
He decided to tell little Alice that he was going across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the ocean again, where there were bees that neither stung
nor gathered honey, where lady tigers—and then, more
tired than he knew, Martin slept.</p>

<p>He saw Alice first the next day and called out cheerily.
But the little girl was quiet. She was holding the new
tennis ball in both hands and her eyes were lowered.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Martin, surprised.</p>

<p>She looked up hesitatingly and Martin was shocked by
the expression on her face. He found it difficult to analyze,
but there was hurt, and fear, and he thought even
horror there.</p>

<p>“My mother told me to never play with you again,”
said Alice, and her voice was so thin and far away it
sounded like a tiny pipe. “Mother said to give this to
you,” and she held out the new tennis ball.</p>

<p>Martin put his hand around it. He was not looking at
Alice anymore, nor apparently thinking of her; for his
vision was directed beyond—at a disassociated blot of
ugliness upon the sky; and he spoke so softly that the girl
could but faintly hear.</p>

<p>“A voice like a reed in an Indian wind,” he said. “Like
a tender, Indian reed.” Then, without addressing the
child, he passed her and walked, with eyes implacably bemused,
toward the corner of sky that held the dark and
obscene smudge.... That afternoon, upon a street he’d
never seen before, he remembered curiously it had been
the first time he had cried in a great while.</p>

<p>In the <span class="allsmcap">PINE LEAF</span>, next morning, his eyes were clear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
his skin bright in the sun; but with all of it, he counted
every measure of his heart. This was a dead passage—a
ship without wings—men beside him shaving without
faces. There was no hastiness in his action, though; and
with impassible restraint he left the Bowery, its fretful
entrances and lanterns thick with sickness.</p>

<p>He went uptown to the Relief Employment Station and
stood in line again. Behind and before him, such pitiful
neatness would formerly have brought the thought of
laughter or poor tears. No more.</p>

<p>A counselor interviewed them quickly. There was a
card on his desk marked <span class="allsmcap">MR. ROBERTS</span>. Martin studied
him with concentration, knowing that this man through
whom he might be placed demanded understanding,
subtle coyness and perhaps, beauty; for he saw a person
hesitant in sex and yet requiring it; a man lurid of
cheek, yet pale; a contradiction with a flush abnormal
as its pallor. The look of Roberts was more theory than
fact; although Martin thought, amusedly, that certainly
this personage, most elegant, existed almost regally. The
counselor’s eyebrows, alert and thin and dark, commanded
all his face. His deep-set cheeks and bold, firm
chin absolved too bright, too wide a pouting lower lip.
His hair, compressed and black, cut strongly in his temples
and took away the color from his eyes. “This masterpiece,”
thought Martin, “should be done in platinum;
with alabaster, ebony and careful points of gold.” And
then, he found that he was next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>Roberts glanced at him.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said. “Are you waiting for a ship?”
His eyes opened wide, closed intimately, then opened
wide again.</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin. “I want a job ashore.”</p>

<p>“Have you had college experience?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Five years.”</p>

<p>Roberts grew cautious.</p>

<p>“Really! Post-graduate work?”</p>

<p>“No. I was never graduated. It was off and on.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Martin hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“I suppose because the electives interested me much
more than the requisites.”</p>

<p>Roberts spoke impersonally.</p>

<p>“A diploma is quite valuable in getting a job,” he
said.</p>

<p>Martin smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>The adviser looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t trying to be rude,” said Martin, “but the
situation appeared somewhat ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“I can well imagine,” answered Roberts, smiling
back at him. “I wish everyone out of a job could develop
the same sense of humor.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a sense of humor,” replied Martin. “It’s a
form of embarrassment. I used to see little girls act this
way in school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>The counselor nodded.</p>

<p>“An acute analysis,” he said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that,” Martin added quickly.</p>

<p>“Of course not.” Roberts was thoughtful. His eyes
had assumed a knowing look. His voice was unprofessional
and the color in his cheeks had become more
prominent. At last, he picked up a card. “What kind of
work do you prefer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve done a good many things.”</p>

<p>“Have you specialized in anything?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s curious. One would think that a young man
with your intelligence would——”</p>

<p>Martin interrupted him.</p>

<p>“I’m not intelligent,” he said. “I’m imaginative.
Sometimes it gives the illusion of intelligence.” Then,
slightly bewildered by his own statement, Martin reflected
on this uncalled-for abstraction until he forgot
where he was and sat absently, with an appearance so
unusual that Roberts, who was watching him keenly,
spoke one word half under his breath; and Martin,
taken from his musing by the unexpected character of
the exclamation, said sharply, “What was that?”</p>

<p>But the adviser, disregarding the question, shrugged
his shoulders—basilisk in state once more.</p>

<p>“Are you really ingenuous,” he asked, “or are you
kidding me? One would think that a young man of
your—education—then, would have prepared himself to
meet inevitable economic problems.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“No.” Martin shook his head. “I’m not ingenuous,
either. I’m conscious. I’m too conscious; it makes me
brittle. Nor am I kidding you. I told you the truth. It is
curious that I didn’t adjust myself. I tried to think
about it occasionally but it didn’t do any good. Other
things seemed more important.”</p>

<p>Roberts was listening intently.</p>

<p>“What other things?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh—pretending. Sometimes other things; but mostly
just pretending.”</p>

<p>“Pretending what?”</p>

<p>“Pretending that I was everything except what I am—that
things were different from what they are. I thought
that life would move on and somehow carry me with it.
I have no way to substantiate this; but all my life I’ve
known that the finish was illusive—that it was best for
me to float with the current until an eddy whirled me
into my right course.”</p>

<p>“Have you struck the eddy?”</p>

<p>Again Martin felt the intimacy of Roberts’ tone and
frowned.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you misinterpreted my question,” said the
adviser coolly. “I asked if you were in your proper
medium.”</p>

<p>Martin flushed and started to rise; but Roberts lifted
his hand in a gesture of restraint.</p>

<p>“I really know how you feel,” he said gently. “Perhaps
that’s why I spoke as I did. In your capacity as a
job hunter, however, there can be no room for individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
conflict; particularly in your relationship with
one who, understanding, offers both his professional
facilities and,” he said more slowly, “his friendship—”
all the time looking directly at Martin with the strange
color coming and going as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Cheeks—like a lost woman,” said Martin, trying to
stop the sentence before it was out of his mouth.</p>

<p>Roberts stared at him for a second in astonishment.
Then he went into uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p>But Martin remained unsmiling.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I said that,” he remarked severely. “I
really can’t excuse it or explain it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not sorry,” said Roberts, leaning forward.
“It’s the first genuine fun I’ve had in a long
time. I’d like more of it. But I’ll confess—it’s disruptive
to the morale of the office.” Still amused, he glanced
around him. His speech was high and unbalanced.
“However,” he went on, becoming more practical, “I’m
going to get you a job.”</p>

<p>“Well—” said Martin.</p>

<p>“No, no,” insisted Roberts. “I’m glad I’m in a position
to help you.” Once more, he looked swiftly around
him and continued in a lower voice. “I think it’s wonderful
to be able to help people. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Roberts hesitated.</p>

<p>“It’s about the only thing there is in the world,” he
said in a still lower tone. “Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>He wrote his address on the card and handed it to
Martin.</p>

<p>“I want you to come to my residence this evening.
There, we’ll work out your economic destiny.” He smiled
faintly.</p>

<p>Martin accepted the card, smiling also, wondering if
he really looked this subjective and, if not, why Roberts’
obvious attitude.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, facing with curiosity a phenomenon
before its occurrence. “What hour?”</p>

<p>“Nine.”</p>

<p>Martin stood up and nodded slightly. It seemed to
him that the employees were watching him evasively as
he left.</p>

<p class="tb">The great city arose with Martin and marched to its
hysteria of noon. Then, slowly falling till evening, burst
into flame, quieted and slept. Gigantic presses told of
her neurosis. In this immutable turning flashed black
lines of the growth of the disease. Its people, wooden-eyed,
marionette, accepted with grimness; their minds
numb and evasive. They held their buildings higher in
the air—pointed them like caricatures of things that had
gone, of things still to come. But their thoughts were
buried. Hidden under music and dust and smothered in
light, the precious balance died....</p>

<p class="tb">The moon, free of clouds, shone through the blinds
and into the living-room of Roberts’ apartment. A crystal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
vase, without flowers, directed the dim light into a
corner. Small ebon figures held out their arms. Roberts
was wearing a dark Russian blouse. To Martin, he appeared
more fabulous and crystalline than in his office.
His flush was constant—so determinate that Martin
guessed it artificial, noticing however, that the native,
restless color had moved into his eyes. There it remained,
fluctuating and searching until it seemed disturbingly
like the luminant phosphorus of uncertain,
yet violent leaves and shadows Martin had avoided in
the tropics. Roberts had been ambiguous throughout the
evening and Martin felt that he knew him no better. But
he watched the adviser closely—watched each apparent
banality for a <i lang="fr">double entendre</i> and speculated upon the
inevitable. He countered each triviality; and made no
attempt to acquiesce in a secretive understanding.</p>

<p>Roberts now grew silent for long intervals. With a
compelling, but a quiet vision, he observed his young
friend. The room had become warmer and frost was
forming on the window panes. Once, Roberts arose and
ran his finger across the glass, leaving a clear, narrow
trail from which fell small drops of moisture.</p>

<p>“It’s colder outside,” he said.</p>

<p>“Much colder,” replied Martin.</p>

<p>Roberts came over and sat down near him.</p>

<p>“Then I take it the warmth of our civilization has its
appeal after all?”</p>

<p>In a different fashion Martin confused the scene in as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
remote and complex a pattern as his friend. Deeply
muscled by the sea, he nevertheless was finely drawn
as a lady’s slipper and as quick of kicking to the notice.
Roberts was aware of this and other features that, to
him, were more demanding and elemental; for in his
bleached eyes Martin carried the ocean; there was the
smell of salt about him—and, Roberts thought, in a sort
of painful hysteria, probably sand in his hair. His face,
out of the Indies, with its stain from the sun and from
his youth, should not hold dignity; and yet it did, in such
a steady, high intensity that Roberts caught his breath
on it. Martin rubbed his foot over the rug.</p>

<p>“‘Warmth’—of your civilization?” he repeated. “I’m
astonished.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the word was ill-chosen,” answered Roberts.
“But whatever our qualities may be, I hope that
you prefer them to those which emanate from the fo’c’sle
of a West Indian freighter. Now, it is my turn to be
astonished. Why did you say ‘<em>your</em> civilization’? Are
you not—” Roberts hesitated, “one of us?”</p>

<p>“I’m a seaman. We don’t fit in anywhere on land.”
Roberts changed—seemed more severe in the passing
light.</p>

<p>“This bold and masterful deception of all seamen is,
to me, Martin, a shabby thing. I see it as a trite avoidance
of each standard which, although sometimes unbeautiful,
is present in the world. Such life, irrelevant
and irreverent of all doctrine, is but a switching of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
responsibilities—a turning of the back that’s shielded by
mere boastfulness. In honesty to myself, I must admit
that there’s a careless beauty in its physical, sweet
shape—the wrap of dungarees—and forgetfulness in
song. And yet, it’s impotent. Quite sterile in its loveliness....
And finally, I see the man—the dungarees—the
very songs in pity.” The color surged into Roberts’
cheeks and he leaned nearer. “You’ve abused yourself,
Martin. There’s been dishonesty in plenty for yourself.
And what, dear boy, quite comes of it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I do it to hear you drain yourself,” said
Martin dryly.</p>

<p>Roberts answered with immediate fierceness.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ve ever talked this way before. But
I’ll use your method now, Martin. You need a job. From
your card I noticed that you’ve been a printer. Can you
operate a linotype?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll arrange things. Now, in heaven’s name—let’s
leave this miserable economic status. It’s impossible.”</p>

<p>Martin frowned slightly.</p>

<p>“But isn’t that why I’m here? You said—”</p>

<p>Roberts’ blue eyes became darker.</p>

<p>“Why not quote our professional introduction literally?”
he asked. “You were trying to amuse yourself,
not help yourself. Why did you do it? Why do you do
it now?” With difficulty he restrained his anger. “A job
should be considered first, before this premature folly.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
He stopped, put out his cigarette and waited, only to be
startled by Martin’s sudden laughter. He raised his
shoulders arrogantly. “You are entertained then, by
emotion?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin. “Rather, by a grotesque episode.”</p>

<p>“Grotesque?” Roberts seemed more contemptuous
than indignant.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Martin, inflamed by this dry attitude.
“Grotesque. Absurd. A farcical horse-opera of a lost
decade revived in different ribbons, different sex. This
renovated melodrama is enough to make one sick!—a
pale girl with a stack of mortgage documents fastened
in her long, blonde hair, arguing for her virtue with a
Russian blouse!”</p>

<p>Roberts listened with fascination. His eyes became
solicitous. The tenor of the room altered swiftly.</p>

<p>“You <em>could</em> have been, Martin,” he said in a breath
and quite excitedly. “Yes, you could have been.” And
then, between his lips, and with no intended insult,
Roberts spoke the same one word that he had whispered
to Martin that afternoon.</p>

<p>Martin looked at the man and knew this exclamation
had never been so used. Without changing his expression
he reconstructed Roberts’ face from the fragments
of thought that had suddenly charged the room. The
pink, hairless mask moved closer—without eyes, without
nose, with a single hole in the lower part and a single,
dreadful sound protruding.</p>

<p>Along the blinds lay a few ravelings of light. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
face regained its natural shape. Only an undermovement
of greediness and a distant, crying sound remained.</p>

<p>Roberts walked over to a cabinet and brought back
a colored liqueur which he offered to Martin, pouring
it slowly and meticulously into Holland glass. He was
once more the host, aloof, charming, courteous.</p>

<p>“How do you think you will like your job?” he asked.
“I’m sending you to a friend of mine—a Mr. Jackson.
He’ll see that you get along.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason to lie,” Martin answered. “I won’t
like it. It’ll be wretched—sitting there, pounding a machine
that is more efficient than I am.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me—why do you want a job ashore? Why
don’t you go back to sailoring? Or, do you really like
that sort of thing after all?”</p>

<p>“It’s a free life,” Martin answered slowly.</p>

<p>“And this is not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But your evaluations interest me.”</p>

<p>Roberts became genuinely curious. All of the coldness
left his face and only the deeper lines of his integrity
remained.</p>

<p>“What is it that disturbs you, Martin?” he asked
gently. “The past or the future? Or the shadow behind
the lamp?”</p>

<p>“I imagine the shadows are worst.”</p>

<p>“You intensify them, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I even create some of them. We demand
contrast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“Mmm.” Roberts, his head nodding loosely, studied
him. “You have something in your eyes, Martin,” he
said. “If you were a woman I would forget my business,
my complacency. I would want to run away with you—if
you were a woman.”</p>

<p>Martin hesitated a moment before answering.</p>

<p>“If I were a woman—you would not be interested,”
he said at last.</p>

<p>Roberts’ face grew white under the rouge.</p>

<p>“You are candid. But my temperament should not
disturb our friendship.”</p>

<p>Martin leaned over, closing his hand about the adviser’s
wrist and holding it tightly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘temperament’?” he asked.</p>

<p>The insolent red came back into Roberts’ cheeks.</p>

<p>“That was young, Martin, my lad. It was cruel.”
Then, sensing the flux of blood upon his wrist more
keenly, he felt curiously strong. Happiness, nostalgia
and strength merged and fused until his mind turned
slowly and hung staring down upon the stages of his
life. Two pale stars drifted upward and dimmed.
Roberts looked into his mother’s eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER V</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Rio lay on a bed in a room on Fourteenth Street.
He was in a bad humor. A back tooth ached and he
sucked hot smoke from a cigarette against it. The Relief
authorities had told him that Martin had signed up, but
had disappeared without report. Had he left New York,
or had he found a job? Had he changed his mind and
caught a ship—Martin was too slippery for an idea to
hold on to. Rio’s irritation increased.</p>

<p>“He never was solid,” he said to the girl sitting across
the room.</p>

<p>“What do you care?” she answered. “You ain’t in
love with him.”</p>

<p>Rio dropped the cigarette butt, pressed his thumb on
the coal and rubbed it into the floor.</p>

<p>“Don’t get mad now, sweetheart,” the girl said. “I try
to be funny. And that’s more than you done.”</p>

<p>Rio sat up, took his coat and left. There was another
chance. Martin might have registered at the Employment
Station. Rio walked along Third Avenue, watching
faces, stopping frequently to glance inside the saloons.
A long line of men, waiting outside one of the Relief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
restaurants, attracted him. One of the men held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Two for a nickel, buddy,” he said, holding his
fingers over the meal-tickets.</p>

<p>“Three for a nickel, pisan,” said Rio, walking on.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when he reached the Employment
Station. Roberts was at his desk when Rio approached.
He was turning over the cards in some files
and did not look up immediately. Rio, a rollicking expression
in his eyes, put his hands on his hips and began
to pose slightly. He looked like a male bear under morphine.
The adviser glanced at him briefly, saw the attitude
and dismissed it.</p>

<p>“Come back to-morrow. It’s five o’clock,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to sign up,” answered Rio, grinning
now. “I’m lookin’ for a shipmate.”</p>

<p>Roberts shook his head.</p>

<p>“They’ll help you at Central Relief Headquarters.
This is Employment.” He spoke peremptorily.</p>

<p>“I know,” said Rio. “He signed up over there and
never checked out, but he ain’t around. I thought maybe
he found a job here.”</p>

<p>“Five o’clock,” Roberts repeated, looking annoyed.
“My secretary will check over the list for you.”</p>

<p>“His name is Devaud,” insisted Rio. “Martin Devaud.
He’s a sort of young guy.”</p>

<p>“Devaud?” Roberts’ eyes were round. “Have I heard
the name? A thin, crippled fellow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Roberts took a pencil and filled in a blank card.</p>

<p>“We aren’t permitted to give information concerning
these men, but if such a person should ever come in, I’ll
give him your name.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Rio.”</p>

<p>“What shall I tell him you wanted—if I see him?”</p>

<p>Rio stuck his thumb against his chin.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to tell him nothin’.” He leaned on
the desk.</p>

<p>Roberts looked at him stiffly. The color surged into
his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Is that all? I’m accustomed to accepting, not giving
information. Unless you give me the particulars I need,
it will be impossible to coöperate with you. Is this boy
wanted for any misdemeanor?”</p>

<p>Rio’s face turned a heavy red.</p>

<p>“This boy ain’t wanted for ‘any misdemeanor.’ This
boy’s a friend of mine. He’s on the beach. I want to see
him.”</p>

<p>Roberts dropped the card on his desk. He showed the
stamp of discipline.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been thrown out of anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Not by ten like you.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately there are gentlemen here vested with
that privilege.” The adviser nodded across the room at
several policemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Rio laughed.</p>

<p>“Fortunately? Gentlemen?” He walked away, then
turned. “I’ll see you later, Mister!”</p>

<p>Roberts watched him leave. Powerful brute, he
thought. Rio! A shipmate. A friend. How good a friend?
Roberts put his finger to his lips. Certainly not a good
contact for Martin. Damn the intimacy of the sea—like
prison, like Devil’s Island, holding men together, destroying
all the niceties of camaraderie.... Were
those stories true about men on ships? A sordid subject
exaggerated out of all proportion—still, some of it must
be true. That big fellow. Was he? He had been unwarrantedly
excited.</p>

<p>Rio left the Station. Mr. Fish inside would look good
with his teeth out. Strictly fruit, huh? By God, these
governors! Well, what of it?... Where to look now?
Martin wasn’t trying to ship. He wasn’t at the Hall or
on the docks. He wasn’t on Relief. He hadn’t got a job
at the Station—or was Roberts lying. “Gentlemen here
vested with that privilege!”</p>

<p>Rio took a train to Forty-second Street. The bright,
flashing lights of Broadway shut out the early stars. The
hurrying expanse of faces had less individuality than
waves. There was no bond between their eyes and his,
impassionate. They were as eternal, as indestructible as
ants. They passed him, died, were born and passed
again; a long, driving throng, pale and imperishable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
typed and counterparted into immortality. Rio turned
away, disgusted. Martin wasn’t there. He’d die in such
a sea. God bless sailors and their drifted lives.</p>

<p>Rio returned to his room and lay down on the bed,
nervous from its quiet. He saw the unused pitcher—one
of dignity; with whiteness and good height. It made him
slightly sick. There was a girl’s bag on a chair; and one
article, too intimate, beside it. He rolled over. Suddenly
the doorknob rattled.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he called out, impatiently.</p>

<p>Two girls walked in, smiling, red-cheeked.</p>

<p>“Hello, Rio,” one of them said. “Did you find your
buddy?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad, Rio.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Rio, unsmiling. “This is amateur
night. Now beat it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER VI</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin worked into the routine of the printing
plant. There were thirty linotypes around him, shielding
him with their clamor. He found retreat in their noise
and liked to feel that he was a lever or cam, bending or
turning inconspicuously in the tide of words. He hid his
revulsion as an automaton and mixed his sweat with the
oil of the machinery. There was an acrid taste of hot
lead in the air, a taste of ink, the taste and rattle of
matrices. Martin could feel his shoulders bend into the
machine—could see the horizon shrink to the area of
light on his copy. Type, type, type—up with the line.
Feel the grinding of the fellow, pressing, digesting. Out
with the slug, searing hot and good to calloused fingers.</p>

<p>When evening came and work was over, Martin
straightened his back and went to the wash-trough. The
gritty soap smelled good, like candy. He associated it
with freedom. Outside, he felt like running—jumping a
hydrant, racing a car. He wanted to shout at the slanting
sunlight.</p>

<p>He lived uptown, at one of the most inexpensive club-hotels
for men. The rooms were clean and, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
standpoint of his present earnings, the cost was reasonable.
Most of the residents were hard-working fellows
who needed a place to sleep. Martin read the recreational
program; but women were not included in its
itinerary, so he remained in his room or walked up and
down the street.</p>

<p>He sat in his room, thinking to a point and back. The
period seemed interminable. The break, the nervous
ejaculation that would throw him out of this treadmill
seemed further away than before. He remembered the
sea and ships upon it, hot rain, salt and rust and bubbling,
rising life. The memory filled his nose and lungs
and mind.</p>

<p>“God damn,” he said, and struck the wall with his
hand.</p>

<p>The buzzer in his room sounded and he went to the
house-phone in the hall to answer.</p>

<p>“Hello, Martin. How are you?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Roberts.”</p>

<p>“I have a surprise, Martin. There’s a little party and
I’d like you to come with me. Just a few people. Would
you like to?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes, I’d like to.”</p>

<p>“Good. I’ll come by for you. It will all be very informal,
very casual.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it will,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I said, indeed it will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Martin could feel Roberts’ eyes over the wire, slightly
protruding, and his eyebrows moving gently up and
down.</p>

<p>“I meant nothing. When will you be here?”</p>

<p>“Oh. Soon. It’s unexpected.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Martin. “Till then.”</p>

<p>He went back to his room and shaved. Next he put on
one black sock and one gray one—not for style’s sake,
nor to be eccentric. When he was dressed he looked
earnestly in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Pale,” he said. He sat down on the bed and stared
at the wall. It seemed a long time to him before Roberts
rapped on the door.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you,” Martin exclaimed with relief.
“It’s you all right—you and your intolerable verve.”</p>

<p>Roberts laughed.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! What finery!” he cried, looking at
Martin’s suit, which was pressed.</p>

<p>Roberts was wearing a Derby. There was a narrow
beaver collar on his dark topcoat and under the fur was
a light, silken scarf. He carried white knitted gloves.
He stood for a few moments in the doorway looking at
Martin. Then, throwing his hat and gloves on the bed, he
went over to the mirror and adjusted his scarf, observing
himself carefully.</p>

<p>Martin lay back in his chair and watched him, a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“You’re beautiful, all right,” he said.</p>

<p>Roberts turned around and nodded seriously.</p>

<p>“I know I am,” he answered. “But there is more
character than feature—that’s what pleases me.”</p>

<p>Martin laughed good-naturedly and got out of his
chair.</p>

<p>“Both qualities are necessary for complicity with
women, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>Roberts gave him a slow, cynical smile and they left.</p>

<p class="tb">Martin was sorry that he had accepted the invitation
to the party when he met his hostess, for her immoderate
greeting brought about a sudden loneliness within
him. Among the guests this feeling of desolation grew
stronger. Their faces and smiles seemed vaporous and
foreign. One large fellow grinned persistently, his eyes
unfocused. Only the hostess retained her buoyancy. She
bounded from person to person with an amazing levity.
There were sentences all over the room, but they were
incoherent, more porous than the faces. Feeling helpless,
Martin went to a corner and sat down. One of the guests
sang “<cite>The Bells of St. Mary’s</cite>” backwards, and Martin
began to doze.</p>

<p>Through his discomfort he heard a new voice. Clear,
apart from the conversation, it held his attention. He
opened his eyes. Near the fireplace at the other end of
the room, on a large divan and leaning far back into it,
sat a blond young man, his legs crossed. In spite of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
careless attitude, Martin was conscious of the earnestness
with which the other regarded him. Fully aware of
Martin’s observation the man continued to look at him
squarely. At last he sat straighter, brushed his hair into
place with a sweep of his hand and gave Martin an
unusually provocative smile. Its good nature was genuine,
but Martin kept to his own melancholy and somber
stare. He had never seen a man with such apparent
knowledge of his blood and caste, nor one so youthfully
wise. Altogether, Martin saw in him a weathered, inbred
prototype of himself, an experienced apprentice. It was
the soil, the rash, the water Martin needed; and he continued
to stare like a child absorbed. It was not until the
young man turned to his companion that Martin realized
that a woman as individual—more quickly individual,
held his strange friend’s arm. Under Martin’s continued
gaze she placed her other hand upon the blond man’s
sleeve and looked up at him questioningly.</p>

<p>In the half-light of the room Martin could see her
profile—could feel the intensity of her womanhood; and
it caused him to forget, momentarily, her companion.
Holding her throat that way, the way her breast rose
under her satin gown, the unnatural silver in her dark
hair caused Martin to speculate—to wonder at his own
abreaction. He felt awkward and indecisive, yet withal,
an inconsiderate urge and tightness under his collar. He
could scarcely restrain himself from walking over and
speaking. But he stayed quiet instead, and felt hot and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
cold at each thought, and finally decided he would just
go away from sheer itching. When at last the woman
did turn to look at him he continued to stare at her for
a moment the same way he had done with the young
man. Then he found that his thoughts were going down
the satin dress to the slim waist and hips that seemed to
be moving under his watery eyes, and down at last to
her stockings.</p>

<p>“It isn’t her legs,” he thought. “It’s her stockings
and every damnable, secret place they lead to.” Looking
up again he saw her young clear lips, tattooed; and, he
imagined, caps of equally bright color under her dress.
Her eyes were the most beautiful of all of her, and yet
the worst; for Martin, in amazement that they should
translate his idiom so perfectly, felt that they were turning
him inside out so that each thought and desire could
be read plainly. However, there was something else
about the woman that made him want to go away, or
come, or do anything as long as it was she who sent him
away, or took him in.</p>

<p>“I’m mad,” he said. “She’s nothing but a brood-mare.
A wild, teasing brood-mare stamping for me. But I wish
I had her in the grass where she should lie.” And he
turned his flushed, wet face toward Roberts who was
approaching.</p>

<p>“At whom are you looking?” asked the adviser, suspicion
in his tone.</p>

<p>“I was watching,” Martin answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“Where are you looking?” persisted the adviser.</p>

<p>“I believe I should go home,” said Martin briefly.</p>

<p>Roberts looked around in the direction of Martin’s
stare and smiled without amusement.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said, sighing and taking his friend
by the arm. “Either one was inevitable, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Without answering, Martin walked with him to the
couch where the young man and his companion were
sitting.</p>

<p>“I want you both to know Martin,” said Roberts. “He
was just going home on account of you. I wonder what
he meant, Deane,” he continued, ignoring the young man
who stood up, smiling unconcernedly. “What did he
mean, Drew?” he asked, this time of the man; and without
waiting for an answer, sat down rather sulkily, peering
from under his eyelids at Deane as though he was
displeased, for Martin and Drew had moved a short
distance away from the divan and had begun to talk
together.</p>

<p>Deane looked at Roberts with understanding, her
brilliant lips open, her cool, dark eyes filled with indulgence.</p>

<p>“Your friend looks interesting enough,” she said.
“Why does he upset you? Isn’t he your protegé? Dear
Ella,” she glanced toward the hostess, “intimated as
much.”</p>

<p>“Damn her fat tongue,” said Roberts. “But,” he continued
wearily, “I wish he were, Deane. I’m part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
him and he doesn’t know it—or pretends not to. I gave
him a rotten job. A job full of grit and lead and ashes
and he won’t—he won’t——”</p>

<p>Deane seemed a little contemptuous.</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>Roberts shook his beautiful head and turned away
despairingly.</p>

<p>“A young girl in her first romance,” said Deane,
speaking now with an undertone of anger.</p>

<p>“You only think me so,” went on the adviser, still
desperate. “But I’ve waited for this a thousand years and
it goes in one bleak night to my one dear friend,” he
looked up at Drew who was still standing before Martin,
“or,” he ended bitterly, glancing once more at the woman
beside him, “to you. I tell you, I know him, Deane. I saw
it in his eyes. He was watching you so. I never saw him
watch me that way. Never!”</p>

<p>Deane looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“You?” she cried. “Watch <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>Roberts, observing her, sat straighter, became more
haughty.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said quietly. “He never looked that way
at me. And <em>I’m</em> mad because of necessity and not an
empty wish! It’s the bone of me—it’s my flesh and the
rancor of centuries!” He stood up, trembling.</p>

<p>“Drew!” he called commandingly. He was white,
beautiful and Satanic in his rage.</p>

<p>Drew started, looked around at him and the two young
men stepped nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“Roberts!” cried Drew in consternation.</p>

<p>But the adviser merely waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Roberts!” said Martin slowly. His eyes half closed,
and in the space where the iris showed came a harsh
light as if misdirected robots were moving behind the
lashes. His face, still burned by the sea, became intent.
It was as though he were concentrating upon a floating
object. Motile, sensitive lines drew around the corners
of his eyes and turned from rust to white. Under this
stare, Roberts faltered in his attitude of severity; and
wheeling suddenly, without excuse, his hands half out,
walked swiftly across the room to the buffet where he
stood, leaning one arm upon it.</p>

<p>Deane sat quietly, watching Martin. There was now
a look of contempt upon his face. It formed about the
fine cheeklines, which by themselves seemed to curl until
the face solidified and grew articulate with sour flutes of
madness. He took a step toward Roberts and Drew caught
him by the arm.</p>

<p>“What is it, Martin?” he asked. “In heaven’s name,
don’t look that way! Be careful! Everyone is watching
you. Stay here with us!”</p>

<p>Abruptly, Martin sat down with Deane, so close that
she could feel him tremble. She looked up quickly at
Drew, who nodded, and with a brief, inscrutable smile,
left them and went to Roberts.</p>

<p>As he waited for Roberts to speak, there was a tactfulness
and grace about him which the adviser could not
evade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“Drew,” he said at last, “listen to me. It’s dreadful.”
He paused to look steadily at his friend. “I can’t work
without thinking about him. I can’t eat. It’s a damnable
obsession! And to think!—with such a shameful lad!”</p>

<p>Drew appeared listless.</p>

<p>“Is that the word, Roberts?”</p>

<p>“It’s the smallest I can think of.”</p>

<p>Drew took a purple flagon containing a cordial from
the buffet, holding it so that he might find its color from
the room’s dim light.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “‘shameful’ is not the word. Rather I
should say,” he hesitated, “‘shameless.’”</p>

<p>Roberts regarded him carefully.</p>

<p>“What is your interpretation of that word?”</p>

<p>“The usual one,” said Drew slowly. “A lacking of,
Roberts. Not a diverting of.”</p>

<p>“You think then, that he has no moral sense at all,”
said Roberts, as though in agreement.</p>

<p>Drew tilted the flagon, observing the changing violet
lights as the clear, thick drops of the liqueur ran individually
down the neck of the bottle.</p>

<p>“It isn’t this important, dear,” he said. “It <em>can’t</em> be
this important.” He was still observing the flagon. “Do
you know this amazing drink?” he asked. “It comes from
a small flower that grows only in the Bavarian Alps,
and at an altitude of between four and five thousand feet.
This very discriminating blossom is called the ‘blue dormant.’ ... A
boy once pointed out to me the place
where they grew,” he said reflectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! Damn you, Drew!” said Roberts miserably.
“Answer my question. You’ve often told me that you,
yourself, were unmoral, not immoral—are you drawing
a likeness?”</p>

<p>Drew replaced the Gebirge Enzian and faced Roberts,
sincerity in his voice.</p>

<p>“You were terribly upset and I chatted a bit. That’s
all. I don’t even know what I said, and I don’t believe
you meant what you said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do.” Roberts nodded his head grimly. “Indeed
I do. Look over there.” He motioned slightly in the
direction of Martin and Deane who were speaking intimately
with each other. “Do you see that, my love?”
he went on contemptuously. “As catching as flypaper
and as promiscuous. And yet I can’t help myself. The
very way he looks at Deane puts arrows into me.” Suddenly
Roberts’ eyes filled with tears, and half choking,
he turned from the guests and from Ella, who was hovering
nearby and who seemed frightfully amused. Instinctively,
Drew stepped close to him, his protective shadow
encircling the bent shoulders of his friend, hiding the
quiet sob.</p>

<p class="tb">When Drew had gone to Roberts, Deane placed her
hand on Martin’s for a moment, then withdrew it gently,
without speaking.</p>

<p>“It was a kiss,” thought Martin. “She’s bringing me
across the river.... A proud woman, with her hair
like the lights of a ship.... A woman sheltered, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
one inalienable to love.... I wish she’d smile again....
God help me! She’s on my trail like a hound! I
might as well have spoken through a trumpet.” Turning
toward her he said, “I really shouldn’t have come here.
I feel out of place. But,” he hesitated, “I thought that
it might be ... and it is,” he added shortly.</p>

<p>Deane started to touch him again, then stopped, for
Martin looked so eager and shy that she became the same
way.</p>

<p>“Damn it!” thought Martin. “What a trip!” ...
“Well,” he said aloud, “it shouldn’t have been.”</p>

<p>Deane laughed softly. Martin could see the black
diagonal stripes across her red kid slippers and this
cabalistic signal took his thoughts back wantonly to the
Church where so often as a child he had released his
theological rut into the dark precipices of the Cathedral.
Those fearfully sweet memories came sharply into his
mind now and he remembered how the vast, swelling
notes of the organ had lifted him up and rocked him
into peacefulness. Nostalgia overcame him as he continued
to gaze at the little red and black slippers. Then
he grimly blocked these crevices of the mind which
exude a flavor too ghastly even for the pith and stench
of the undersoul, and he spoke again, this time without
thought or conception.</p>

<p>“I mean,” he said, “that for a long time the parties
I’ve gone to have been so apart from this sort of thing—that
is, apart dimensionally. The people were plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and simple. There were rivers, mostly yellow, and bushes
and trees to lend informality, and all the music came out
of parrots. Once, along such a river-path, I met a man
with a nose as broad as my fist. His dark skin had such
heavy needlework upon it that it was beveled like tooled
leather. His feet splayed like a water-creature’s. We
couldn’t speak each other’s language, but we both understood
food. It made us friends. We had mashed rice,
water, and some kind of grape he’d brought out of the
forest over his shoulder.” Martin stopped abruptly at
Deane’s curious look.</p>

<p>“I’m sure there was that and more in the tropics,
Martin,” she said deliberately. “There was the Right
Honorable Lord Jesus stamping through the jungle.”</p>

<p>Martin, embarrassed and yet amused, looked steadily
at Deane.</p>

<p>“Such things can, and should be reduced,” he said.
“I’d have been impatient, myself.” He hesitated, unable
to keep from staring at the soft line of her throat where
each shadow lay like a bruise upon her skin. This intimation
of her feeling for light, of limbs too tender,
made him lift his intense eyes to her own which were
even more brilliant. “Please,” he continued, “will you
please let me take you home?”</p>

<p>Now, Deane saw him differently, with more excitement.
What an enigma! And what a charming transition
from his faint braggadocio (or was it!) to this straightforward
question. She knew that he was waiting for an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
answer, yet she was silent. Silent while they kept turning
their heads to reassure each other like naughty children
in the cool green brush and willows by a railroad
track. They knew. They understood completely; and
Martin, in this Roman anticipation, shivered; and when
at last they did stand up to separate only for a moment
they still seemed to cling together helplessly. Once, as
they crossed the floor, Martin paused, and Deane, aware
of his intention, went on alone. She disappeared into the
hallway, and the sight of her sweet entirety, her gown,
the thought beneath it made Martin caustic and erect.
Only then did he look around to see that Drew and
Roberts were observing him. As he came up to them,
Drew greeted him warmly, but Roberts held his face
away.</p>

<p>“We were talking of compassion,” said Drew, smiling.
“It takes sophistry, Martin.” He turned to his other
friend. “Isn’t that true, Roberts?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It takes common sense,” said the adviser.</p>

<p>“It takes that, too,” said Martin. “It takes sophistry
and common sense and a hundred other things. But I
prefer to leave it to the Giver.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Roberts angrily. “It takes the god-damned
miserable Giver!” Then more softly, “Deane
Idara is a remarkable woman, Martin. You realize that
she has recently suffered a severe shock?”</p>

<p>“No! A shock, you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Roberts’ eyes shone above the sudden pallor of his
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “She lost her husband only a very
short while ago.”</p>

<p>“Why did you tell me that?” asked Martin rapidly.
He tried to quiet himself, but he bit his lip and looked
at Drew rather wildly. “I understand death. I too have
died. I too have seen intimate death.” The phosphorus
shone again in his eyes. “Cowardly remark!” he said
under his breath.</p>

<p>The adviser seemed to draw within himself, growing
even more pale. He spoke sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you, too, Martin, have lost a
husband?”</p>

<p>Martin glanced again at Drew who was standing motionless,
expressionless, then back at Roberts. He could
scarcely move his lips.</p>

<p>“I’m going home,” he said. “Goodnight, Drew. And
goodnight, Roberts.”</p>

<p>“Goodnight,” Drew answered, holding out his hand
to detain the adviser who was automatically following.
“Goodnight, Martin,” Drew called after him again.
Then, “Roberts!” he whispered uneasily, still holding
his friend’s arm. “You don’t have even the foundation!
<em>Won’t</em> you be sensible?”</p>

<p class="tb">Deane Idara was standing at the door. Martin’s shadow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
fell across her face and they left the apartment. Outside,
the air was high and pointed with light. Crisp new stars
whizzed over them, brightening the street. Martin could
feel her arm get tighter and tighter, and his own breath
became heavier until in the darkness between corner-lamps
he swung her round to him and kissed her cold
little wet lips. With his arms around her and the feel of
her lips becoming warmer under his, he whispered, “I’ll
kill you. Oh, by God!—I’ll kill you, I love you so!”
And then he kissed her again until he felt himself just
going away as he had thought he would. Deane was pressing
as tightly as she could against him, but her head
seemed to fall back too loosely and Martin kept saying,
“I’ll get a taxi, dear. I’ll get a cab.” He waved at several
until one stopped, and after they had climbed inside he
pulled Deane to him and asked, “Where are we going,
dear?” She kissed him, and Martin could feel her breath
on his cheek. The cab driver slumped down in his seat
indifferently and lit a cigarette. “Where are we going,
Deane?” Martin asked again.</p>

<p>“Not far,” she answered, nodding to him feverishly.
“Tell him to drive up the street. It’s one sixty-nine....”</p>

<p>Her apartment was dim and motionless. A long window
faced the line of city buildings. Martin and Deane
stood before it, breathing the soundless air. In this black
and white panorama he felt indistinct, separate from his
identity. He had removed his topcoat and he imagined he
could feel Deane’s skin against his, so tight was her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
black gown. They stood by the window, holding each
other in a sensuous embrace of expectation—of change
of clime. Then he thought of her stockings and her sacramental
slippers. They were furiously beautiful and revealing
against the rug. Martin put his hand within her
blouse and held it there while she pressed closely to
him. He unslipped a button, then another, and another.
“I’ve buck fever, Deane,” he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>Deane shook her hair, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>“You helpless bastard,” cried Martin to himself....
“Let’s break it, Deane,” he whispered to her once more.
“Let’s break it completely,” and he pulled the loosened
gown from her white shoulders. “And here’s mine,” he
went on, continuing the motion until his opened shirt
and singlet were flat against her breast. “We’ll call it the
wild black clogs of Belgium, dearest,” and he clenched
his hard brown arms around her waist. Without speaking
further he took her hand and led her into the adjoining
room. He sat down on the gray paneled bed, pulling her
surely beside him. Deane saw the slight trembling of his
lips and the heavy expression of his eyes which stirred
her with an intoxication that was close to fear. She was
drawn by the swift pace of his emotion, yet held back
by the certainty of his demand. Even as she was thinking,
the rapid heartbeats against her became more rapid and
the pressure of Martin’s hands brought so definite a response
that all vaporous abstractions were forgotten and
she knew herself in an immediate physical presence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Wanting Martin as she did, the knowledge of his action
brought no idle gestures; and she was quiet, with eyes
half closed as she felt herself lifted, then rested, with
Martin’s arm for a pillow. Infinitesimal beads of moisture
formed on Martin’s temples as his hand caught the
rim of her stocking, but the warm, soft flesh above it
made him cry out softly. The very lights seemed tenderer
and the very shadows kinder as these two lovers held
each other. The night was penetrated by a question, by
a sob; and all the cruelties and perversions of humanity
were justified by this union—natural, unashamed and
magnificent in simplicity and passion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER VII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Roberts waited near the printing plant the following
afternoon. When Martin came out he went swiftly to
him, holding out his hand. There was haggardness and
strain—a formation of new lines in Roberts’ face.</p>

<p>“I could hardly wait till you were through work
to-day, Martin,” he said anxiously. “I have been terribly
distressed over last night. I feel that it was my mistake—entirely
my mistake. I was overminded by my zealousness—or,”
he hesitated, “by my jealousy. You know how
I feel about you. You do know, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Martin, following his emotion, rather than the outposts
of his mind which usually warned him, was drawn
to Roberts by this speech, so painful and revealing.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Roberts,” he said, “there wasn’t any
mistake. But if there is anything deserving such a name,
we’ll forget my fault, and yours.”</p>

<p>Roberts sighed with relief.</p>

<p>“Then you <em>will</em> forgive your old mother?” he asked
contentedly.</p>

<p>“I forgive myself and you,” repeated Martin.</p>

<p>Roberts did not hear, or hearing, did not understand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
A strong impression of brotherhood made his hands
tremble. A feeling of careless happiness exhilarated
him. The vision grew clearer and his heart tried gallantly
to keep pace with his mind’s picture of the Affinities,
striding hand in hand against the foolish tide of
intolerance and misunderstanding. He took Martin’s arm
and started down the street, a new freedom in his eyes.</p>

<p>“We are going to have dinner together to-night,
Martin.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Roberts, but I have an engagement.”</p>

<p>Roberts laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll come, all right!” He swung on to Martin’s
arm. “We’ll have the most glorious dinner of our
lives. We’ll put the table by the radio and have our
sherry with Bach—yes, with Bach. But you may have
Delius with your Chablis.” He shook his finger in Martin’s
face and laughed again. “I warn you, however, our
Benedictine will call for Wagner! The renegade!—The
impious Pretender! We’ll swing his stomach like a bell
over our Benedictine.”</p>

<p>Martin’s cheeks were sucked in. He seemed ready to
laugh but his eyes were shaded.</p>

<p>Roberts, still chuckling, glanced at him carelessly in
his merriment and was astonished.</p>

<p>“Martin!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. Some other time I’d like to. But to-night,
I can’t come.”</p>

<p>Rage, a positive hatred, shook the adviser. Words of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
reproach and anger were about to be spoken when he
was deterred by the same quality in Martin’s face that
had quieted him before. This time, even in his shame,
he tried to analyze the reason—to connect and precipitate
Martin’s features into the symbol that stopped his
fury. He felt that it was an earth-impression—a breath
of old winds—a shade of substratum clay—a distillation
neither spatial nor timely. He saw Martin’s face in retrospect
as the outline of a rising mountain crag, lonely
within the moon; or as the shaping pseudopods of cloud
that are confusing in their similarity to some ancient
clot of memory.</p>

<p>But Roberts was not easily defeated. He spoke evenly.</p>

<p>“We <em>must</em> have dinner together to-night.”</p>

<p>“I have an engagement,” repeated Martin.</p>

<p>“An engagement! <em>Our</em> dinner is important.”</p>

<p>“My engagement is the kind you can’t break.”</p>

<p>“Really!” A supercilious expression flitted across Roberts’
face and his one sharp word carried an air of volubility.</p>

<p>Martin, looking straight ahead, made one more effort.</p>

<p>“Won’t you walk down this way with me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“But this is a special dinner,” protested Roberts, following
him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. I didn’t realize your social program was
so strenuous.”</p>

<p>“This is the first thing of its sort,” Martin replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“First thing of its sort?” Roberts laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Martin answered. “That was awkwardly put.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Roberts, a mimicking expression on his
face. “Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“Let’s not break this, please.” Martin spoke earnestly.</p>

<p>Roberts’ voice acquired a superior tone.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, Martin, if your sense of values is
unintelligent,” he said.</p>

<p>“I wish you would understand.”</p>

<p>“I do understand.” Roberts held his finger in the air
warningly. “Don’t let some transitory illusion make a
fool of you, dear boy.”</p>

<p>“‘Transitory illusion?’” asked Martin absentmindedly.
“It has a history and a future.”</p>

<p>“Deane Idara is a clever woman,” observed Roberts.
“But you have a job.”</p>

<p>Martin smiled queerly.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t my job depend upon my work?” he asked.</p>

<p>Roberts stopped abruptly and faced him.</p>

<p>“I can tolerate rudeness, but not unkindness,” he declared
with dignity.</p>

<p>Martin took the other by his arm.</p>

<p>“I want to be as good a friend as you’ve been to me,
Roberts,” he said, trying to speak calmly. “Every contact,
economic or social that I have, you’ve made for me.
I’d not be myself if I were unappreciative. That’s not it
alone, though. We have many things together—food—and
music—isolate cynicisms—and all these have their
place. You understand. You know, also, that even with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
the best of friends, sometimes a path divides. Certain
diversions, certain loves, are found impossible in
common.”</p>

<p>“But love is what I need,” said Roberts quietly.</p>

<p>“That element is fugitive.”</p>

<p>“And still I need it.”</p>

<p>“The whole world does,” insisted Martin.</p>

<p>“But I, especially.”</p>

<p>“It’s too difficult, Roberts.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is difficult,” he replied. His voice was sorrowful.
“Martin! Break this date with Mrs. Idara.”</p>

<p>“It has more than precedence, Roberts.”</p>

<p>“I demand it.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Martin, a feeling of exhaustion coming
over him, “I’m afraid there’s no alternative. I turn down
here.”</p>

<p>Roberts’ wide blue eyes looked white in the twilight.</p>

<p>“We’ve been fools, Martin. We should never quarrel.
Let’s forget all this. Come on.” He was like a small
boy pulling at Martin’s arm. “We’ll have wine and
chicken. We’ll have mushrooms.”</p>

<p>It might have been a sob.</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>Roberts, blinded to Martin, stared at him. Then he
turned swiftly. His eyes darkened in the first lights of
evening and he walked hurriedly away.</p>

<p class="tb">Roberts’ face superimposed the view from the window
where Martin stood with Deane. Its expression was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
somber and equivocal. Through this skeletal haze they
watched the city’s significant pantomime—the silhouettes
and flashings, the play of shadows below them.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen Roberts, haven’t you?” asked Deane
quite suddenly.</p>

<p>Martin looked down at her bright sandals. She was
wearing a deep blue hostess gown, nearly the color of
the evening sky. A burnished cross, held by a woven
cord, fell from her throat and lay between her breasts,
and again Martin saw the silver within her hair as mast
lights over the water.</p>

<p>She picked up a cigarette and lit it for him. Around
the tip, the moist red paste from her lips left a scarlet
ring. She put the cigarette in Martin’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, holding the smoke in his lungs, “I’ve
seen Roberts. But he has no place up here.”</p>

<p>Deane looked at him strangely.</p>

<p>“He disturbs me, Martin. I don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“He disturbs, me, Deane. He wanted me to have dinner
with him to-night. When I told him I had an engagement
he knew it was with you. One wheel in his brain
spins on an eccentric.”</p>

<p>“What can he do?”</p>

<p>“He can kill the copper goose—cause me to lose my
job. And it’s all wrong. We like each other. We should
have been good friends. I admire him. He has a mind,
and my brand of humor. The first time I saw him at that
Relief place I was attracted to him. I wanted to know
him better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“But couldn’t you see that he was—different?”</p>

<p>“You call it ‘different.’ Roberts calls it temperamental.’
Rio would call it——” He stopped.</p>

<p>“Rio! Who is Rio?”</p>

<p>“Oh. Rio? He was a shipmate. An individual. Sometime
I’ll tell you what I know about him.... But to
get back. I did know that Roberts was different. I believe
I knew it the first time I saw him. It didn’t interfere with
my admiration for him. I was lonely. Hard work on ships
had surfeited me with the physical. I didn’t hesitate at
the specter of consequences—although I did anticipate
them. I believed that I could handle them. I couldn’t. You
see, Roberts was convinced that I, too, was ‘temperamental.’”</p>

<p>Deane made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“He had no reason to think that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did,” said Martin thoughtfully. “Perhaps
he had a combination of reasons. First of all, I took no
pains to hide my interest in him. Perhaps he misunderstood
the motive. And then, there are gestures and expressions
that are open to suspicion. The line of demarcation
in such friendships seems variable. Roberts wanted
me to belong to his group, and whether the misconstruction
was artificial or genuine, he arrived at a conclusion.
Tell me what you know about him, Deane.” He turned
to her impulsively.</p>

<p>“Then I must tell you of his mother, Martin. She was
as luxuriant as himself and more. She was pure crystal
with the same high febrile cheeks, but an attitude so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
strong that I always felt his should be less. I’m sure
though, that no one could touch her but himself—at least,
I felt she swept along in an invulnerable carriage of
glass, indifferent to any but her son. William Roberts
finds his coloring from her, and his bearing, and his remarkable
beauty; for,” Deane observed in reminiscence,
“he wears a tie or scarf the way she wore her pearls, as
though they were a part of her throat. They were glorious
pearls—a small dark strand with a diseased, slow luster,
indistinct in tone, but so inseparable from her body that
when her skin assumed the radiance we see in Roberts,
they followed her as though they loved her. What her
husband meant to her before his death seemed of little
importance; for her life, so obviously, was contained in
Roberts’ glance, his frown, or contradictory expression.
These two were more like complementary figurants intent
upon each other in their mutual demand than like
a mother and son. That he adored her showed in every
action—from the way he placed her shawl—” Deane
looked at Martin briefly, “from the gentle manner with
which he drew her shawl over her exquisite, proud shoulders
(it was like a caress!) to his affectionate concern
over trivialities—her slightest expression, or even
guarded undertones that no one knew except themselves.
Once, I saw them when he became aware of a woman
speaking—I knew it was without intent—and then I saw
his mother’s strength. She never moved—no line of her
face changed; but everything in the room became alive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and hard. To me, it seemed that the tender pearls around
her throat turned into steel. The woman who had been
speaking with Roberts became confused, faltered, and
he seemed ready to rise from his chair. But at this,
his mother smiled faintly and spoke graciously to the
other woman. It was all right, apparently; but I was
chilled and felt ever so glad when the party broke up.
Shortly after that, Martin, the mother died, and I am
sure that part of Roberts went with her.” Deane was
speaking intensely, with a fixed, unusual look toward
Martin which he accepted steadily. Since he would not
speak, she made a curious remark. “This, you knew,
Martin—not the way I told it; but you knew.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “Yes, I knew.” He turned from
her, staring out of the window into the darkness.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang.</p>

<p>“It’s Drew,” said Deane. “No one else would come
here at this time——unless——” she looked at Martin, and
for a moment seemed to be less assured. Then she lifted
her head. “No! <em>He</em> wouldn’t—Roberts wouldn’t dare!
I’d better answer.”</p>

<p>Drew entered and kissed Deane lightly on the cheek.</p>

<p>“You’re lovely,” he said, holding her arm affectionately
and extending his left hand to Martin who, embarrassed,
knew of nothing but to squeeze the delicate, closed
fingers.</p>

<p>Drew smiled faintly and sat down, crossing his slender
legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“I just left Ella, poor girl,” he said, with a sigh. “She
wouldn’t have a doctor. So she called me.”</p>

<p>Deane looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ella sick? Why, she seemed very well last night.
Should I see her?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t bother,” said Drew, smiling faintly again.
“I gave her a bromide and devotedly held her hand till
she went to sleep. She’ll be all right in the morning.”</p>

<p>“But what happened?” insisted Deane.</p>

<p>Drew leaned forward and spoke more seriously.</p>

<p>“I’m glad both of you left when you did,” he said.
“Roberts drank consistently—a thing he’s never done
before, and left in a stagger, vowing he would never see
Ella again. He spoke rather madly in his apartment, too.
I stayed with him most of the night.” Drew sighed once
more. “Of course, both of you are to blame.”</p>

<p>“It’s ridiculous!” said Deane, her dark eyes brilliant
with anger. “Is Roberts out of his mind?”</p>

<p>Drew did not answer, but settling back in his chair,
took from his pocket a gold cigarette case inlaid with
an exquisite Mosaic design in various metals, opened it,
and without offering its contents to the others, selected a
rather bulky cigarette which he lit at once, before returning
the case to his pocket. A singularly aromatic odor
was first noticed by Martin. He looked at Drew in surprise.
Then a wisp of smoke floated toward Deane who
wrinkled her nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“One of your disgusting cigarettes,” she said. “I don’t
see why you smoke them.”</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful herb,” replied Drew contentedly.
“Martin understands it.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Will you smoke?” Drew inquired of him, reaching
for the case once more.</p>

<p>Martin smiled slowly and shook his head.</p>

<p>“But I can see it in your eyes,” persisted Drew.</p>

<p>Deane looked at Martin excitedly, then turned to the
other.</p>

<p>“Please, Drew, don’t ever offer Martin hashish.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Drew, slightly amused. “So you know!”
Then, taking a long, deep draw on the cigarette, he let
the smoke escape in little puffs from his mouth and
nose. His attitude became more languorous. The timbre
of his voice changed and he sighed. “A quiet night,” he
said. “My lovely friends.... You <em>are</em> lovely, aren’t
you?” he continued, speaking carefully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Martin, studied and frowning.
“Lovely.”</p>

<p>Deane reached over impulsively and laid her hand on
Drew’s.</p>

<p>“Won’t you put it out, darling?” she pleaded. “I hate
to insist, but it gives me a feeling of——”</p>

<p>“Of apprehension,” supplied Drew, rising slowly and
slowly crossing the room to the open window. He tossed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
out the half-smoked cigarette, then returned, partly on
his tiptoes.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t smoke like this,” said Deane
quite urgently. “It gives you bad dreams. You hate yourself,
too.”</p>

<p>Drew raised his hand with a listless movement.</p>

<p>“Later—perhaps. But now everything is very sweet.”
He smiled dreamily. “This clarity, after my extreme confusion,
forgives an old sin. An image!—memories unfolding
that bring a figure more alive than you.... A
splendid figure.... Burning with clandestine color....
Unfaithful!... He tried, though, more than
I....” Drew leaned back again, resting his head
against the chair. His lips were partly open and there
was a flush of pleasure upon the high oval of his cheek.</p>

<p>Deane arose without a word and went into the kitchen.
Martin imagined that she was making coffee. As the
aroma came into the living room, Drew opened his eyes,
looked at Martin and shivered.</p>

<p>“A good awakening,” he said, smiling nervously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Martin. “The cigarettes are mild.”</p>

<p>“Too mild,” said Drew. “I should have eaten the salve,
but I was afraid. I was nervous from spending last night
with Roberts. It was terrible to see him act the way he
did. He cried out once. It was like a bellow.” Feeling
slightly dizzy, Drew stopped talking for a moment and
wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>Martin waited quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“This evening,” Drew continued, “I went to my bedroom
and took the jar from my cabinet, holding it as
though it contained radium. I was uncertain, as I always
am on approaching this Nirvana; but to-night I was
afraid. As I removed the lid, exposing the ointment, its
ungodly musk affected my breathing. There was something
sinister in its appearance. I peered deeply into it,
and the jelly seemed to glow and change from a dark
green to a paler color. It trembled and faded to a lighter
shade, and stayed that way. Then the odor poured afresh
into my nostrils. I felt staggered and closed the lid.”
Drew shivered again, then relaxed in his chair, while
Martin watched him.</p>

<p>Deane brought in three steaming cups of coffee. Martin
drank his hurriedly, taking the hot liquid in large
swallows. Drew sipped his, while Deane’s remained
untouched.</p>

<p>Seized with excitement after this fresh stimulant,
Drew arose suddenly, put down his cup, turned to Deane
and said, “I must go. And I know you will understand,
Deane, if I ask Martin to leave with me.” With feverish
haste he put on his coat and Martin, with an expressive
look at Deane, followed him from the apartment.</p>

<p>As Deane fastened the door after them she leaned upon
it for a moment, her forehead resting against the panel,
her small hands tightly closed.</p>

<p class="tb">Drew and Martin walked swiftly up the street, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
cold night breeze whipped in from the Atlantic. Martin
turned down the brim of his hat and put his hands into
the pockets of his topcoat. Drew looked around at him.</p>

<p>“Would you like to be at sea to-night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking about it,” answered Martin.
“There isn’t a bad night on land but that I think of the
men on ships.”</p>

<p>The air seemed to exhilarate Drew and he spoke again,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Will you answer a rather intimate question, Martin?”</p>

<p>“If I can.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be angry. But are all the stories that seamen
tell—I mean the tall tales—just fancy, or are they
mostly true?”</p>

<p>“That’s a trade secret,” said Martin thoughtfully,
noticing that Drew’s classical manner had become more
feminine since they had left Deane’s. Then, as though
suddenly changing his mind, he added, “Yes, Drew. Most
of them are true. You don’t have to exaggerate or romance
about the sea. It gives you a bellyful whether you
want it or not. Of course, all the adventures that sailors
tell about probably didn’t happen to them. But they happened
some place and to someone. I have a good collection
of tales I’ve swapped, and I couldn’t tell you right
now the true ones from the borrowed.”</p>

<p>Drew took Martin by the sleeve and they came to a
halt. There was a curious, understanding expression in
Drew’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I like you very much,” he said. “Please don’t misunderstand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
me, Martin, but I think a great deal of you.
I’d like to know you better—to have your friendship.”</p>

<p>“You have my friendship, Drew.” Martin held out his
hand and was surprised at the other’s firm, steady clasp.</p>

<p>Drew nodded his head in the direction of a subdued,
blue glow on the opposite corner.</p>

<p>“There’s a cocktail lounge,” he said, “where once in
a while I go when I’m tired of routine. I’ve never taken
anyone there before, but I’d like you to come with me
this evening. It’s very quiet—a place where one can rest
or think as he desires. Will you?”</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to,” Martin answered simply, still wondering
at Drew’s eagerness.</p>

<p>A waiter hurried to them as they entered.</p>

<p>“Mr. Noland,” he said, bending his head slightly before
Drew. Then, glancing at Martin with mild, respectful
curiosity, he led the two men to a small booth in a
remote corner of the lounge where he received their order
and left quietly.</p>

<p>Martin was attracted by the room—its lighting, the suggestion
of avidity. Directly across from them, and near
the wall, a fountain sent up a soft golden spray from its
center, around which individual columns of multi-colored
water rose and fell. A mural, hung just behind the fountain,
caught its indiscreet fires. There, the lights blended
into a seeming gradation of silver fungus until only the
sharp blue antlers of a stag, at the top of the painting,
stood out thirstily over the water.</p>

<p>Martin looked away from the fountain. Drew was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
watching him with a reflective expression, with such a
gentleness foreign to men’s eyes that Martin was immediately
intent. For there, in Drew, he saw the central,
fine equation between his friend and savage, weeping
Lesbos. The two united, defying by extreme cunning and
deceitful fingers a dogmatic scythe of science which uses
the symbol X for one impossible of definition. And what
he saw beneath, caused Martin to tremble and lean back
in his seat, with his heart beating faster as though the
secret had been upon his lips or in his mind. However,
that fever which comes upon a man as he sights dimly
before him the object of his life’s search—the feeling
that it might kill if the secret was discovered, left him
suddenly. Vaguely he knew that he had touched the
edge of it, and that was all. In one way he was glad that
the revelation had not come to blind him. He was not
ready. Nor could he, by any trick he knew, even follow.
There were years before him, other trails to entice him,
so he argued. And as he opened his eyes, rather painfully,
Drew, concerned and full of question, brought him
round again to sanity, and not a mind deliberately
drugged by the spin and shuttle of the fountain’s aimless
<i lang="fr">carrousel</i>.</p>

<p>The waiter came at this moment and set the glasses
upon the table. Even the man’s crisp, white hair seemed
a part of the scheme of the lounge, Martin thought.
Fancies, ridiculous and uncalled-for, occurred to him in
succession until he wished that he could stay quiet forever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
with Drew, whom he trusted most of all in this irrepressible
hysteria. However, the waiter withdrew quickly
enough, resting his hazel eyes only for a moment upon
Martin, who spoke to Drew with a restrained irritation.</p>

<p>“Was this intended?” he asked. “It seems, Drew, to
be something planned.” He waved his hand impulsively.
“All this,” he continued, “is native to you and unfamiliar
to me. It has—it has a quality—” Martin stopped
talking.</p>

<p>Drew picked up his drink.</p>

<p>“I suppose it does have what you say, or suggest,” he
answered. “I’ve felt it many times. But it was not defined
to me before to-night. I came here to rest, because it was
restful; but I shall never come here again, because you
have given it a suggestion of intimate life which is offensive.
It wasn’t planned at all, Martin, and I was never
native until you said so.” Drew leaned forward frowning,
puzzled. “What kind are you?” he asked. “You,
Martin, could vulgarize the very Church.” He sipped his
drink, although Martin left his own glass untouched.
“Prosaic as it may be,” Drew went on, “it is not myself
with whom I’m concerned. It isn’t myself, or Roberts, or
even you that I am most deeply worried about. It’s
Deane.” He lifted a finger, decisive, commanding. “In
her you have found sweetness, tenderness and passion—a
physical, well trained animal. Don’t speak!” He held
his finger warningly again as Martin’s brooding shoulders
straightened. “You’ve talked uncannily enough,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Martin, to make even me wonder. I love your thoughts—the
upside down philosophy that makes me laugh when
I believed I could never laugh again. But Martin, you
surely won’t abuse this powerful—yes, this beautiful
gift with Deane. Don’t misunderstand me, I beg of you
once more. It isn’t evil, Martin, to use a weapon at your
command. It isn’t really that you’re a devilish anti-Christ,
as I first thought.” Drew lowered his voice, speaking
almost frantically. “It may be that you are even
Christ himself. You have your Cross and finally you’ll
rest there. For you are no more invulnerable than the
Man on Calvary, who under pressure—under striated
clouds asked for an end of it. Is there anyone <em>you</em> can
ask in that intolerable moment?” Drew wiped his forehead,
drank deeply and spoke again, although he avoided
Martin’s flaming eyes. “I repeat,” he persisted, “‘that
intolerable moment!’ And it matters very little whether
you consider me a fanatical, abusive priest, or—” and
now the spray from the fountain seemed to lean toward
Drew. Heavy lines of moisture which he failed to notice,
covered his forehead. “Martin,” he said, “I know Deane.
I love her ‘in my fashion.’ I—I too, was taken from a
medium of ordinary happiness into this rarefied, spiritualistic
land you understand so well.” Unable to speak
further, Drew brushed his handkerchief across his eyes
and placed his hands upon the table. To his astonishment—almost
to his grief, he saw them tightly gripped by
Martin, who seemed to hover over him, transfigured....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>They got up and put on their coats. With surprise,
they noticed that the shutters of the lounge were drawn
and that the bar was untended. Alone in a corner, the
white-haired waiter sat dozing. Drew pressed a bill into
the hand of the sleepy attendant and opened the door
himself. Out in the street the wind was blowing harder
than ever and a pale green light clung like a heavy paste
to the eastern horizon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER VIII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin left the typographical plant. He thought
he was a funny one. Being fired made him feel a little
childish. It might be hurt or anger, or it might be something
more esoteric. He didn’t know. But his face was
colorless and his eyes gleamed unnaturally.</p>

<p>“I guess it isn’t anything to sigh and fret about, ‘dear
boy,’” he said. “It was Roberts, of course; and I can’t
buck him. This city’s even more of a machine than I had
thought.” He walked until he was thirsty, went into a
restaurant and had two cups of coffee. Then he walked
some more. He stopped in at another restaurant and tried
to eat. He couldn’t. So he had a third cup of coffee and
decided to call up Roberts. The conversation was pertinent.</p>

<p>“It’s Martin Devaud. Is Mr. Roberts there?”</p>

<p>“Hello, Martin. It’s myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m fired. May I see you this evening?”</p>

<p>“Come at six.”</p>

<p>“Right.” And they hung up.</p>

<p>Martin continued to walk. His throat was dry and he
yawned frequently. As evening approached he grew more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
and more nervous. Several times he lost his bearings and
with some difficulty he found Roberts’ street. In the elevator,
which was warm and a little close, he tried to keep
himself from shivering.</p>

<p>Roberts was dressed in black trousers and a white shirt,
starched, but open at the collar. He greeted Martin extravagantly,
then seeing his pallor, so unnatural, he
brought out whisky and soda.</p>

<p>Martin held up his hand.</p>

<p>“No soda,” he said.</p>

<p>Roberts’ eloquent features absorbed at once the harshness
of Martin’s despair. He understood. Nevertheless,
propriety made him ask, “Straight? That’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Straight, please. And it’s not half so dangerous just
now for me as being sober.”</p>

<p>Roberts shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You may take the bottle, if you care to, and lie down
with it,” he answered petulantly.</p>

<p>Martin looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“A drink will suffice,” he said.</p>

<p>Roberts flamed and quieted and the color came again.</p>

<p>Martin smiled a little maliciously as he watched him.</p>

<p>“What a story, or picture!—if you wept in all that
brilliance!” he said calmly.</p>

<p>Roberts poured his own glass to the brim with whisky
and drank it before he answered. His eyes were hot—completely
without modulation.</p>

<p>“Drink yours!” he commanded, pouring another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Martin took the glass to the window and threw it,
whisky and all, into the street.</p>

<p>“May it kill!” he said, whiter-faced than ever.</p>

<p>“You talked to me once of melodrama,” said Roberts
acidly. “I’ve never seen it so rampant, so unorthodox, so
uncontrolled. I’ve had enough! Tell me—tell me—or by
God!——”</p>

<p>“I want to know if you had me fired,” said Martin,
simply.</p>

<p>Roberts became placid at once. He waved his slender
hands and, half-closing his eyes, smiled patronizingly.</p>

<p>“Surely you do not—” he began, when Martin cut
him off.</p>

<p>“Surely, hell. I wondered. I thought it was probable.”</p>

<p>Roberts still watched him from under his lids.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I said I’m fired.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I want to know why.”</p>

<p>Roberts folded his hands. It was almost a gesture of
dismissal.</p>

<p>“I talked with your employer, Mr. Jackson,” he said.
“The conversation, I must say, was disappointing. He
told me frankly that your work of late had been lax.”
Roberts cleared his throat. “I’ve been somewhat afraid
of that. You can’t burn the candle at both ends, Martin.
The social and the economic won’t mix.”</p>

<p>“Roberts—save your platitudes for a darker night!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Martin was glaring at him. “So that was really it! You
intimated as much at one time.”</p>

<p>Roberts went over to him, touching the back of Martin’s
hand with indescribable tenderness.</p>

<p>“Are you tired enough now, my friend, to have a
drink with the one man in the world who sees you in
your entirety?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll drink,” said Martin wearily, leaning back
in a chair and closing his eyes. He took the glass from
Roberts, holding it loosely, and drank from it without
thinking.</p>

<p>Roberts now put his hand on Martin’s head.</p>

<p>“I have given my time to place you,” he said gently.
“You would not rebuke me for that.”</p>

<p>Martin felt the lassitude of the whisky, of the words;
yet some fundamental stroke of his own blood kept him
from acceptance. He seemed to hear a bold, ancestral cry,
and sat straighter.</p>

<p>“You’re modern, Roberts. You have a modern sword.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never hurt you, Martin. I’ve tried to help.”</p>

<p>“Of course. But your body is too demanding.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?——”</p>

<p>“I won’t fence. I’ve seen an ugly mind—an inexpensive
one.”</p>

<p>“Devaud,” said Roberts, in a sharp, clear voice, “you
don’t belong among civilized people. One can’t talk to
you decently without your making an unpleasant issue.
You’re a confounded savage and worse, because you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
have the instruments of this superficial world, too. And
all of your cruelty—yes, you’re cruel!—and I suppose
all of your vices are tucked under your fine exterior.
No wonder Deane is intrigued! But if she could see you
just as I see you now, with that brutish look in your
eyes, then——”</p>

<p>Martin interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention her name,” he said, in a low, moody
voice.</p>

<p>Roberts moved away from him quickly.</p>

<p>“Martin—did you make this appointment to build, or
to destroy?”</p>

<p>“Neither. I just wanted you to know that my understanding
belongs to you.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s the only thing that belongs to me.” Roberts
spoke bitterly. “Martin! For the last time I ask you to
forget a cycle that has brought you only unhappiness.”</p>

<p>Martin got out of his chair.</p>

<p>“You should never try to be clever with me, Roberts.
I respect the frank demands of the body. Petty intrigues
disgust me. Your intricate desires have overruled your
intelligence. As an invert I respected you. As a subverter
I find you intolerable.”</p>

<p>Roberts walked toward him, motioning, his head shaking.
His shining black hair fell across his face which had
turned from red to a lurid purple. The white part of his
eyes took on the same color. His appearance was that of
some monster in a fable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll—” he said, “I’ll not—I’ll not—” his head
bobbed up and down. “I will never let you——”</p>

<p>“You’re prodding yourself sick,” said Martin in disgust.
“You’re jarring the very devil out of yourself,”
he flung at him and left the room, his shoulders swaying.</p>

<p>Martin went to a liquor store and bought a gallon of
wine. In his room, he sat down on the edge of the bed,
kicked off his shoes and began to drink. Half-drunken,
he lay back and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>He awoke in the late morning. He knew his position.
The contact had been broken. Sick from the evening’s
drinking he got out of bed and looked at his face in the
mirror. His cheeks were pale and there was an unhealthy
expression in his eyes. He felt his heart. Its methodical,
heavy beat disturbed him. He poured a glass of wine and
drank it swiftly. The nerves deadened. His apprehension
died and he stood again before the mirror, regarding
himself calmly. He shaved and dressed, took another
glass of wine and went out, going directly to the typographical
plant.</p>

<p>His former employer was writing. Martin looked at
him vaguely, hesitating before his desk.</p>

<p>“What is it, young man?” asked Jackson, glancing up
with impatience.</p>

<p>“No one told me why I was fired,” said Martin indistinctly.
“Will there be anything later?”</p>

<p>His condition seemed a little pitiable to Jackson, although,
the employer told himself, such individualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
really belonged outside the mathematical régime of commerce.
One had to dispose of them accordingly.</p>

<p>“There will be nothing later,” he stated firmly. “You
were inefficient. I can see no reason for returning you
to this Company.”</p>

<p>“I want to work,” said Martin. “That’s the reason.”
His fingers rubbed the top of the desk and he looked
unsteadily at the man behind it.</p>

<p>Jackson arose.</p>

<p>“You’re drunk, Devaud,” he said. “It is not a question
of personalities. Good-day.”</p>

<p>Martin gave him a perplexed look. The impeccable
tailoring of his employer’s suit had suddenly become offensive
to him. Completely bewildered by this strange
revulsion, Martin turned and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” he said, and went down the steps and
out into the street. “Good-day,” he kept repeating into
the ears of astonished passers-by. He stopped, after he
had wandered awhile, before a restaurant; for he smelled
the aroma of coffee. Then he shook his fist at the window.</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> won’t split this illness!” he said, and walked on,
mumbling.</p>

<p>In his room he sat down once more on the edge of the
bed. His mind, levitated by wine and discouragement,
projected itself. Images rose before him. Secretive, luxurious
women were in his fantasy. He drank again and
went to bed. He slept, awakened, washed his face and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
slept once more, reality and the dream becoming as one.
Day and night passed.</p>

<p>The sun rose, slanted, fell over the windowsill and
crept up the bed into Martin’s eyes. He awakened, his
heart pounding. He stood up and finished the last of the
wine.</p>

<p>“Internal application only!” he observed. Repeatedly
the mirror drew him. “Poison if taken externally,” he
continued amiably; then seeing the foolish expression
on his face, turned away in disgust.</p>

<p>He looked at himself again.</p>

<p>“Emancipation!” he shouted. “To business! To weaving,
undecipherable sex and even my own hot mouth!”
In amazement he looked into the crypt of his eyes. That
soft sound of weeping.... “From the ceiling,” he
cried. “Not from these French fried lips!” He went back
to bed.</p>

<p>In a dream he placed his hand on his hard body.</p>

<p>“The unborn,” he whispered, breaking his hand on
himself. “Modest child of onanism.... One daughter
who will not ride the world on her ruby-jeweled bird’s
nest!... One lad who will not ride the world on a
bird’s nest!”</p>

<p>He awoke and looked at the ceiling. The room was
death. Outside, snow was falling, flakes padding the
window. He stared into the darkness. To escape without
struggle—his body falling—and then, rest—infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
deep and sweet.... His imagination stretched steeply
into awareness. Not into chaos or unreality. The wind
pressed snow on the window, through the window and
into his arms. He felt the cold. Holding his hands into
the air, he prayed....</p>

<p>“God!”</p>

<p>No bright arm of light; no sound of wings. It was four
in the morning and his terror had grown to a deadening
satisfaction. The rose shadows of steepled city buildings
at night rang dimly in his court, their inner warmth full
of promise and engaging noise. He looked out of the
window, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Too young and stupid, my infantile prince,” he said,
and touched the gooseflesh on his arm, kissing with faint
disdain its embarrassed nubs. “Back to bed again to sleep
and jump like a poisoned cat.” And another day waved
her dreaming, blue hands, regretfully——</p>

<p>Martin knew an alternative in that purple morning.
A gun—the shot—the quick flutter of his hand.</p>

<p>“No,” he whispered. “Too demure. Fruitful, but
demure.”</p>

<p>Outside, the sun blended into trucks and the yapping
noise of turning wheels. He dressed and went into the
street, stopping at the nearest bar. And strangely, in all
his tiredness and fear, arose the man as he had been—straight
from the ocean, with clear eyes that had watched
the sea so often, and with hand half-raised as though
holding the helm of his ship. It was momentary; but the
bartender stood looking at him quietly and with respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“A Guinness’s Stout,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“A nip or a pint, sir?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“A nip and a pint.”</p>

<p>The black liquid hung to Martin’s glass as he raised it
to his lips. The stout ran through his dry throat and into
his stomach, washing away the starved slime. It spanged
against his knotted intestines, loosening their disgusted
quiver. It broke the cordy fold of nervous tissue.</p>

<p>Martin bent over the bar, touched by its rustic intimacy.
Out of its shining, wooden face arose the image
of Deane, slim-throated, filling the mist. She moved
closer. Martin mused over the bar and drank, and drank
again. The liquor sank to his nerves and he awoke.</p>

<p>Deane forgotten?... Her bell-like gown drifting
over his teeth—sprung from the fog—outlined in the
smoke of his thoughts....</p>

<p>The subway was crowded. Meaty faces lined in pink,
pale array before him. A woman, mother of too many,
rubbed a glove over her nose, worry misting her eyes, a
dustpan supporting her neck. Across from her perched a
she-gazelle on meatless haunches, hair and breasts correctly
arranged. The train stopped and Martin went up
the stairs into the cold wind. He entered a building and
walked down the hall to Deane’s apartment.</p>

<p>She opened the door and stood before him, a bright,
tremulous blur. He swayed a little and she caught him
by the shoulder, assisting him into the room. He tried to
stand straight, smiling gently through his brackish eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Deane, but I can’t stop my mind,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
said. “I can’t stop it from turning.” He licked the dry
scale of his lips. “I can’t do it.” He closed his eyes tightly
to keep in the moisture and talked on rapidly, glibly.</p>

<p>From the window came the city lights. Deane sat in a
chair, brooding, a frightened look on her face; for Martin’s
hysteria grew in the strength of evening. His motions
became more selfish. Every idea turned upon itself.</p>

<p>“Somewhere,” he said, “there is a worm. A relentless
worm canting my words, embarrassing me—deep,
vicious and blinding.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do, Martin?” All of Deane’s
tolerance—her understanding and affection were contained
in this question; but he was deafened with pain
and apprehension and all the seeds of disaster which
fall, germinate and grow so swiftly in certain poisonous
gardens. He put his hand across his face.</p>

<p>“Let’s get a doctor,” he said. “A magical doctor ...
a sorcerer ... a doctor for a sorcerer.”</p>

<p>Deane nodded her head. And if he could have seen her
then, in the gown he loved and with all the concern in her
eyes, it might have taken him from this evil spell. But
he was blind and sick and walked like a dead man; while
in his agony he cried, “No! Nothing! Get nothing!” Tormented,
he went across the room to her, and as he faltered,
Deane caught him in her arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER IX</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin felt the hum of an elevator, fresh air in
his face and the movement of an automobile. He knew
that he was talking too much to an individual he’d never
seen before, and suddenly found himself in a long bright
corridor that smelled of medicine. He was helped into a
semi-darkened room and felt a glass between his lips.
He thought of Roberts, swallowed and choked.</p>

<p>“It’s ether,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” said the nurse, standing by him and
trying to get him into bed. “It will be good for you.”</p>

<p>Martin saw her for the first time. Then he felt himself
falling. The nurse steadied him, and suddenly everything
was clear. He felt well, stimulated. He wanted to
talk some more.</p>

<p>“So! Martin finally reaches Hell! Our pathological
bundle of yeast becomes animate in Bedlam!”</p>

<p>“<em>Won’t</em> you get into bed?” asked the nurse. “You will
be sleepy in a minute.”</p>

<p>“All right.” He stood up, swaying. “Martin in Hell.
Being tucked in bed by an angel with wide hips. Coasting
to sleep with a bellyful of ether. A true Nirvana for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
a true aesthete.” He stopped talking. Again hysteria
struck him. But this time it was soft and languorous and
he held it tightly as it moved in his groin. His breathing
was quiet.</p>

<p>The nurse sat beside him in the darkened room. He
breathed slowly now, beginning to jerk and posture. He
held his hand in the air as though emphasizing a dream.</p>

<p>In the early morning he awakened. His hand moved
over the side of the bed, reaching for a bottle of wine.
His fingers went back and forth over the rug. Then he
opened his eyes and saw the woman sitting beside him.</p>

<p>“Are you my nurse?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m your nurse. Won’t you go back to sleep?”</p>

<p>“I hurt,” said Martin. “I hurt all over, but my back is
the worst. And I need a drink.”</p>

<p>“What would you like?”</p>

<p>“Whisky. A big one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get your medication,” said the girl, and left the
room.</p>

<p>Martin looked around him. A hospital—neurotherapy;
adjacent to a madhouse! Weakened your resistance
in one and shipped you into the other! His body
ached and his mind still turned. On with the medication!—and
then what? From dipsomania to dope in
twelve treatments. Bring on the bed-straps. Damned
efficient nurse, that one—watching him jump around.
Patient. If only his back wouldn’t hurt so terribly. Must
be the kidneys. Need flushing. Why not use a plunger?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Imagine that immaculate nurse astride him, pounding
his gizzard with a plunger!</p>

<p>The nurse returned with two glasses. One was full of
orange juice. The other she held away from her nose.</p>

<p>“More ether?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“It isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, ether or not—down the hatch!” And taking a
deep breath he swallowed.</p>

<p>The nurse steadied him once more and he pressed his
head into her breast, breathing sharply, like a man struck
in the throat. He allowed himself to tremble. His feelings
changed from sick horror to quietude and a faint
elation. He let his head drop on the pillow. This time
the paraldehyde brought relief, but no immediate sleep.
Words kept ringing in his mind and he talked on, without
cessation. The nurse listened to him, laughing occasionally.
In the morning’s light, Martin slept.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the nurse was gone. He was alone on
a bridge with madmen. He was afraid. Afraid of what?
Afraid of fear. A word sounded in his mind—phobiaphobia,
fear of fear. Nothing tangible to fight. The deep-seated
root of the worm in his imagination. His feeling
of isolation became complete, unbearable. He got out of
bed and walked into the hall. A student nurse looked
warily at him as he approached—unshaven, with bloodshot
eyes, his unfastened robe trailing.</p>

<p>“Where’s the head nurse?” he asked. “Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Here I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>Martin turned on her, white faced and trembling.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, nurse. Is this a hospital? Get me a
drink. Get me something. And don’t leave me alone.”</p>

<p>She helped him into bed and brought the same medication.
Sober, terror-stricken, Martin could not face the
shock of the incredible drug. The nurse held him, and
again Martin drank, feeling the same shudder and movement
of the deep-seated tissue. He reached out and felt
the woman’s arms. A sharp, sweet odor in his nose prolonged
his trembling. The nurse wrapped a blanket
around him, leaned over and kissed his damp forehead.
Martin rested, watching her move quietly around the
room. Was her kiss a gesture of sympathy? He met her
gentle brown eyes and knew she understood.</p>

<p>The greater part of the next two days and nights he
slept, only awakening to drink the bright, relieving
poison. The third day he remembered Deane—her laugh,
the surge of her skirts; and each thought was a torment.</p>

<p>That evening two psychiatrists came to talk with him.
One, his own doctor, young and solemn; the other, the
consulting physician, mature, shrewd, Olympian. Martin
explained his fears, bringing up the residue of his experiences.
During his story he caught fragments of remarks
from the older man. Suggestive words such as
<i>masochism</i> and <i>sadism</i> set fire to his imagination. When
they left him without comment he was more lonely and
fearful than before. In desperation he entered deeper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
into his mind, finding new horror with each analysis. By
night the momentum had grown to such an active fear
that the nurse did not dare leave the room. Martin followed
her with his eyes.</p>

<p>The special night nurse came on duty, fresh, buxom
and cheerful. Martin drew new hope out of her vitality.
As he watched her straightening his bed he felt resentment
at his own weakness. What was he?—to be fussed
over and coddled like an old dog. He watched the strong
shanks of the girl move steadily around the room. A
curious thought entered his mind and he laughed. The
nurse turned and looked at him, fearing new hallucinations.</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin, “I’m not hysterical. Come here and
sit on the bed.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Martin, “pull that chair closer and
sit here.”</p>

<p>She did as he requested, and Martin reached out for
her hand. It was soft and warm. He pressed it tightly,
looking into her eyes. The girl’s cheeks flushed but she
did not pull away. Martin looked up at the ceiling, each
fresh thought bringing anger—the keen, strong happiness
of anger. This young animal beside him had given him
a new perspective. He turned again to the nurse and held
her hand more tightly, stroking it, and explaining his
movements with his eyes. He reached out for her waist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and smiled to see her pull away. She was afraid. Not he.
What did he have to be afraid of? Phobiaphobia? How
foolish! This complex, that complex——</p>

<p>“Listen, nurse,” he said. “I’m cured.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You seem to be much better.”</p>

<p>“Better nothing!” cried Martin. “I’m well. There isn’t
anything wrong with me. I was drunk.”</p>

<p>The girl stared at him for a moment, then put her
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’ve never believed the things you’ve told me,” she
said. “At first, I thought there was something a little
bit—” Her cheeks turned red and she laughed. “But
now, I know you’re just a normal man.”</p>

<p>Martin thought of the woman he loved. Deane! He
could go to Deane now. There was nothing wrong. He
thought of his doctors. Surely they had known. They had
left him with that fear—its implication of neuroses and
reference to disgusting complexities. How many lay that
night, fed with bromides and sedatives; crucified on
theories!</p>

<p>In the morning when the psychiatrists returned, Martin
raised his head from the pillow.</p>

<p>“Good morning.”</p>

<p>The young doctor nodded his head briefly, blinked his
eyes and faced the light from the window, his face expressionless.</p>

<p>“Good morning. Did you sleep?” asked the older physician,
in a perfunctory tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“Very well indeed,” Martin said. Then sitting up a
little straighter, he added, “Doctor! I don’t want to anticipate
a diagnosis, but I’m not sick. You understand that
I merely gave a history of the fantasies and sublimated
desires that are in all our minds, but which we are rarely
dyspeptic enough to publicize.”</p>

<p>The older doctor watched him furtively. Martin saw
that he resembled a spider, and grinning to himself,
thought that there were probably a few cobwebs about
him. But in the younger doctor’s eyes he saw concern and
liking, and even the faint touch of friendship.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the older man at last.</p>

<p>Martin climbed out of bed, put on his robe and stood
before the consulting psychiatrist.</p>

<p>“You understand.”</p>

<p>“You have been a child,” said the physician sternly.</p>

<p>“You understand,” repeated Martin.</p>

<p>The psychiatrist took firm hold of his shoulders. There
were furious lights about the man—not understanding;
merely curiosity and hatred for something unintelligible.
He tightened his grasp on Martin’s shoulders, shook his
head angrily and stormed out of the room. But the
younger doctor, with all the suns between his eyes, observed
in formula Martin’s pulse and all the rest of it,
dismissing his patient with a friendly, sympathetic nod
as soon as he could.</p>

<p>When Martin left the hospital it was snowing. The
medication had destroyed his orientation. He leaned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
against the wall of the building for a moment, then tried
to walk straight while he looked for a taxi.</p>

<p>Inside the cab he wrapped his coat about him and held
his ankles from the cold air. Sick from the drugs and
weak from lack of food, he thought once more of Deane
and smiled. He was tired, but he had won.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the apartment he stopped just inside
the door. There was a woman sitting in a chair. Who
was she? Where was Deane? Was this woman alive? For
her face was pale, and her eyes, too large, too dark,
seemed to have lost all comprehension.</p>

<p>“What is wrong?” he asked excitedly. “What is it?”</p>

<p>Deane did not answer but sank down in her chair,
covering her face with hands that trembled.</p>

<p>Martin felt sick. The air in the room suffocated him.</p>

<p>“Deane! It’s Martin!” he cried.</p>

<p>Her hands dropped to her lap.</p>

<p>“I talked with your doctors,” she answered simply.
“I talked with them for two hours. I was ashamed—humiliated.”</p>

<p>“Ashamed of what? Ashamed of me? Why! I’m all
right now!”</p>

<p>“I spoke with your doctors,” Deane repeated, as
though in fatal acceptance. “It was horrible.”</p>

<p>Martin took off his coat. He had on no shirt. He looked
past Deane for a moment, leaning heavily against the
wall.</p>

<p>“They have taken my girl.” He spoke bitterly. Then in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
a louder, more distracted voice, he repeated—“<em>They
have taken my girl.</em>”</p>

<p>He continued to look about him as though in a daze.</p>

<p>“What have they done to you?” he kept asking. “Damn
them! Collaborators with madhouses—sucking my giddy
ideas, engendering the malingerer. They’ve doped you
with psychological jargon, hypnotized you with fine
phrases.... Breeders of hypochondriacs! I’m not
afraid of them any longer, I have nothing but contempt
for them. I wanted the clear advice of mature, impersonal
intellects, and I meet with personal vindictiveness.”</p>

<p>“They said you have a persecution complex,” replied
Deane. “They tried to help you.” Her throat was dry
and the room was spinning round.</p>

<p>“‘Persecution complex!’” repeated Martin with a contemptuous
gesture. “It’s contagious. It’s a disease—an
indiscriminate application of words typing an individual,
placing him in a box, granting him the elasticity of
brick. They are dealing with humanity—not with bricks.
What do these rigid intellectualists know definitely, after
all? Stumbling about in the most infantile science of the
lot. A befuddled group of astrologers of the mind. The
more competent admit they know little—admit that while
they do the best they can, that often they must strike out
blindly, hoping that nature will effect a cure.”</p>

<p>Deane’s eyes did not change; but the delicate lids,
with their heavy lashes, gave a sudden, nervous flicker.
What was this perspiring man talking about? She still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
felt sick. He didn’t have on a shirt. If she could only
rest. She knew that her mind was bleeding. Each of
Martin’s words opened a new point in her brain.</p>

<p>“They are dangerous because they are clever,” he
went on. “And some of them are diabolical. Theirs is a
subtle lechery. They love this parade of erotics. Orgasms
by proxy! Intelligent, perverted and ruthless!”</p>

<p>Deane now looked steadily at him. The ice locking her
mind moved restlessly.</p>

<p>“They do good, Martin. Not everyone plays with love
and pain the way you do.”</p>

<p>“Let me rest, Deane. I want to rest.” He leaned for a
moment against the divan and then got up. “You’re the
only one I care about,” he said wearily. “Can these
ponderous technicians, with their burden of world-pain
give you happiness? Can you let their hard lines of conduct,
which apply to the diseased, disturb our concept of
life? Top-heavy and non-elastic—surely they cannot appeal
to your ideas!”</p>

<p>Deane knew that he was splendid in his agony. She
wanted to kiss his cheeks. She wanted to forget his tiredness,
his indictment of psychiatry. She felt that his imaginings
were unfair; untrue; those of a sick man. She
knew that he had talked bravely and fought desperately
for her. She felt all these things. But she stood up and
turned away.</p>

<p>Martin knew. He put on his coat and smiled at her. He
wanted to tell her that he loved her. Instead, he left the
apartment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER X</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Rio went down to the Seaman’s Institute for breakfast.
He had come to a conclusion about Martin. He felt
that it was useless to look for him. And Rio needed the
sea. It would be easy to get a ship.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean?—Algiers on a hot night, a skiff
rubbing its brown keel on a plaque of sand. Turpentine....
South America?—Through the deep night
wind one single light on Tierra del Fuego, an invalid
blonde on the cruise ship, port of Rio.... Intercoastal?—The
French “Babee” Quarter in Cristobal,
water changing under the heat.</p>

<p>Rio scuffed his shoes on the concrete floor and looked
up moodily. Then he saw him. Martin was sitting alone
at one of the small tables. Rio pushed back his chair and
walked over to him.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, looking at Martin’s white face.
“Well.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Rio.” Martin raised his cup, but the coffee
spilled before it reached his lips, and without drinking,
he replaced the cup on the table.</p>

<p>“You’re a fine guy,” Rio was frowning.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“Try again.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Rio took his arm and they went into the street. In
Rio’s hotel, Martin lay down on the bed. The other sat
beside him.</p>

<p>“You ain’t quite so funny now,” said Rio.</p>

<p>Martin nodded.</p>

<p>“Where you been?”</p>

<p>Martin raised himself on his elbow.</p>

<p>“I’ve been playing bats with a visitor from Saturn.
You know it has many moons. The visitor told me all
about them.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Rio dryly. “You only got one. But it
ought to be kicked.”</p>

<p>“It has been,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“You son-of-a-bitch.”</p>

<p>Martin couldn’t manage sympathy and started to cry.
He didn’t make any noise and there were no tears. There
was just a choking, helpless movement as he looked
steadily at his friend.</p>

<p>Rio got up, lit a cigarette, then sat down once more on
the bed and put the cigarette between Martin’s lips.</p>

<p>“I know all about it, buddy,” he said. “Once in Dairen
I piled off a ship....” He looked away as dreamily as
a big ape.</p>

<p>Martin laughed inside to see this fellow trying to be
tender, but he listened to the story and it made him feel
better. Finally he sat up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“One night in the tropics, Rio, you told me I wasn’t a
sailor. I knew you were right, so when we came into
New York I got off. I went on Relief and met a man
named Roberts at the Employment Station. He was intelligent
and interesting, but he was like this—” Martin
held out his arms.</p>

<p>Rio nodded.</p>

<p>“However, that didn’t make any difference,” Martin
continued, lying down again. “And later, he got me a
job.”</p>

<p>“Now ain’t that pretty,” said Rio.</p>

<p>“He got me a job,” Martin went on, “and asked me
up to his place. Anyway, to make this a good yarn, along
came the girl. I liked her. Roberts’ vanity was hurt.
Perhaps he even liked me. But I thought I loved the
girl.”</p>

<p>“You do.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. I do.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“So Roberts had me fired.”</p>

<p>“So?”</p>

<p>“I got drunk and the girl told me I was through.”</p>

<p>“You weak punk,” said Rio.</p>

<p>Martin hit him in the face. It was a glancing blow off
Rio’s nose and there wasn’t any drive behind it. He tried
to get in another one, but Rio shoved him back on the
bed and held his shoulders down. Martin saw that the big
sailor was grinning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all right, buddy,” said Rio. “How about some
food?”</p>

<p>Martin looked at his friend’s nose. There was a trickle
of blood coming from it.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, still watching the blood which
was dripping over Rio’s lip.</p>

<p>“Here’s a couple of nickels,” said Rio, laying a bill
on the bed. “Get some sleep and some food.”</p>

<p>Martin sat up again.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Down to the docks.”</p>

<p>“What ship?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Steeldeer</i>.”</p>

<p>“Where’s she going?”</p>

<p>“Around the Loop.”</p>

<p>“Any chance to make her?”</p>

<p>“The crew’s signed on.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to see you go.” Martin couldn’t stop the
hurt in his voice.</p>

<p>“I ain’t goin’,” said Rio, not looking at him. He left
the room without further explanation and Martin went
to sleep.</p>

<p class="tb">It was Saturday afternoon and the office force at the
Employment Station had gone home. Roberts alone remained.
He was writing when he heard someone come in.
He did not look up.</p>

<p>“My name’s Rio.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>The adviser threw down his pencil.</p>

<p>“I remember you,” he said, regarding the man in
front of him with intense annoyance, “I might add—unfortunately.
I have no desire to see you. I have not seen
your friend.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Roberts. I got some news. I seen him. I seen
Martin, the cripple.” The big sailor laughed. “He was
thin, at that.”</p>

<p>Roberts went around the desk and faced Rio.</p>

<p>“Get out,” he said.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Roberts!” Rio was still smiling. “I like
you.” He rubbed his face gently against Roberts’, who
moved back in astonishment and disgust.</p>

<p>“I said, <em>get out</em>!” The adviser spoke between his teeth.</p>

<p>“But I like you, Mister.” Rio put one hand back of
Roberts’ neck and the other across his cheekbones. The
adviser tried to move but the pressure stopped him. He
stood quietly, his eyes looking frantically back and forth,
the color in his cheeks flickering. Rio squeezed harder.
Above the hand on his face Roberts could see his torturer
dimly. The pain changed to lassitude and Roberts
wasn’t afraid anymore. He remembered that he had
dropped his Derby on the street a night or two ago. He
had intended to send it to the cleaner’s, but had forgotten
it. He could not condone such negligence. Then he
went to sleep.</p>

<p>Rio looked at the man he was holding. Roberts reminded
him of an old sailing vessel on which he’d once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
made a trip. She’d struck a reef off Cocos Island. Rio
had watched the ship from the beach. Her stern was up
and her sails dead. A red anchor light flickered like this
man’s eyes before she sank in shoal water.</p>

<p>He carried Roberts to a chair behind the desk. Then he
left the Employment Station, went to a phone booth and
looked up Deane Idara’s address.</p>

<p class="tb">At the Employment Station Roberts heard someone in
the hall. He tried to open his eyes, although it didn’t
make any difference. It was probably that fellow returning
to make sure that he had killed him.... Again
came the strange fancies. It seemed to Roberts that he
was chasing his Derby which was now being driven violently
down the dusty street by the wind. Thump—thump—thump
it went along the sidewalk, and at each corner,
when he thought he had caught up with it, the wind
would rise, and he would have to dash after the hat,
trying desperately to retrieve it before the wind got hold
of it again. “The cleaner can never make it right now,”
he kept thinking dismally. “The dirt will be ground into
it.” And once more, the hat made funny, hollow-sounding
noises as it turned over and over on the pavement. Suddenly
the Derby changed shape—growing enormous,
building out misshapen shoulders, becoming a terrifying
bulk which turned on him. Stricken with horror, Roberts
fled before the onslaught of the monster. Thump—thump—thump—
A janitor walked into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Roberts!” he cried. “Mr. Roberts!” He ran to
the telephone and tried to dial the operator, but his
hands were shaking too much.</p>

<p>The adviser knew how he looked. He knew that his
mouth was open. Perspiration was pouring from his face
and hands. He fought off the darkness. He got his mouth
closed. With consciousness came pain—a sharpness at
the base of his neck that made him sick.</p>

<p>“Leave the phone,” he commanded sternly.</p>

<p>The janitor hesitated.</p>

<p>“Leave the phone,” Roberts repeated. He could move
his arms now and was able to sit straighter in his chair.</p>

<p>The janitor picked up his broom, looked at the adviser
again and started sweeping. Roberts was writing when
the janitor left.</p>

<p class="tb">Rio got out of the elevator and was approaching
Deane’s apartment when an elegantly dressed young man
stepped from her door, closing it behind him. The sailor’s
anger rose at the thought that this woman should betray
his friend, as so it seemed. And when the two men
neared each other in the hall they both hesitated as if by
mutual agreement—Rio, still in his murderous rage,
Drew in curiosity. They were barely moving as they
started to pass each other. Rio scowled, then stopped a
moment to stare at the other, who merely lifted his eyebrows
and looked at the small bouquet in his own lapel,
smiling as if he had a notion. Rio’s face became red.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Thoroughly embarrassed at his mistake, he could not help
but smile back. His healthy, undisciplined grin allayed
any possible apprehension on the part of Drew who continued
down the hall.</p>

<p>Rio found Deane alone. He thought he had never seen
a woman so foreign to him—so sweetly unattainable that
for one slow instant his deep native blood rebelled,
reached out in mind, then caught itself. He held his cap
when he sat down.</p>

<p>“I won’t be long, Mrs. Idara,” he said. “My name’s
Rio.”</p>

<p>“Martin has mentioned you, Rio,” answered Deane. “I
thought it was you.”</p>

<p>The big sailor glared at her.</p>

<p>“I just left Martin. He’s sick.”</p>

<p>“I know.” Deane looked away.</p>

<p>“I’d help him, Mrs. Idara. But he don’t need me.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t need anyone but himself, Rio.”</p>

<p>“He needs a good woman,” answered Rio coldly.</p>

<p>Deane looked straight at him.</p>

<p>“That is—a stupid one?” she asked.</p>

<p>For a moment Rio stared at her helplessly.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” he said at last. “I can’t talk. But Mrs.
Idara, Martin ain’t the first to break his neck over a
woman—only mine died, and her skin wasn’t your color.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Rio. I’m sorry it had to happen to you.”
Deane made a little gesture of sympathy.</p>

<p>Rio thrust his head forward.</p>

<p>“That’d work better on a live man,” he said bluntly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“Is Martin alive?” Deane spoke as if to herself.</p>

<p>“He’s crazy,” answered Rio, “but he ain’t dead. And
he never lost all his bearings till he met you. He even
handled Roberts.”</p>

<p>Deane was astonished.</p>

<p>“You know Mr. Roberts?”</p>

<p>Rio twirled his cap in his hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. He’s a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“You’re a friend of both Martin and Roberts?” Deane
asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“I can get along with anybody.” Rio looked at her
and some of his hatred appeared in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You love Martin very much, don’t you, Rio?”</p>

<p>“Maybe. He said so one night. The way you and him
throw that word around, though, it means anything.”</p>

<p>“I intended it to be a good word, Rio—a brave word.”</p>

<p>Rio grinned. Deane thought it was the strongest, most
vicious expression she had ever seen. She wasn’t afraid,
but such clear hatred made her hesitate.</p>

<p>“Rio,” she said finally, “I love Martin. But I won’t let
him escape the world. It isn’t fear that makes him try it,
but he has a quality of evasiveness that clears him from
all reality. It has been convenient for him at times, but
some day it will destroy him. I love him too much to let
this happen.” Deane was tired. She felt older. She didn’t
even know that her eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>Rio stopped smiling and stared at the floor. Suddenly
he got up and went over to her.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>He put on his cap and Deane walked to the door with
him.</p>

<p>“Rio,” she touched his arm, “tell Martin I need to see
him. Will you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him, Mrs. Idara.” Deane’s hand against his
arm upset him. He wanted to kiss her. That moment he
hated Martin. “I’ll tell him,” he repeated, and walked
down the hall, looking surprised.</p>

<p class="tb">Martin was sleeping when Rio returned. He awakened
and saw the big sailor looking down at him.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I seen Mrs. Idara. She wants to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“You saw Deane?” Martin sat up.</p>

<p>“She wants to talk to you,” Rio repeated.</p>

<p>“You’re high-handed.” Martin shook his head. “What
about the <i>Steeldeer</i>, now that you’ve seen me over the
bumps?”</p>

<p>“You ain’t over the bumps, and I don’t want the
<i>Steeldeer</i>. There’s a boomer in next week, and no goo-goos
in the messroom. I’ll see then.”</p>

<p>Martin tried to hide his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Unaccustomed as I am—” he began.</p>

<p>“Stow it,” interrupted Rio, jamming his cap on his
head. “You got a job. I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Martin. He got out of bed and
put on his coat. Then he stood looking solemnly at
his friend. “I’ll probably be back next week—or
sooner——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“You better go.”</p>

<p>Martin kept looking at him. Then, without speaking
further, he turned suddenly, went to the door and walked
out.</p>

<p>When Rio could no longer hear his footsteps he sat
down on the bed and lit a cigarette, but put it out immediately
and carefully laid it on the washstand. For
awhile he paced back and forth in his room. Then he
went down to the desk and called out to the woman
behind it.</p>

<p>“Where’s the Brat, Rosie?” he asked.</p>

<p class="tb">Rio left the Brat and went to the waterfront. The salt
air, the breeze and the innocuous drainage of people
took away some of his disgust. The <i>Comber</i>, bound for
Buenos Aires, was tied up at Pier V 9. A watchman
stopped Rio at the gate.</p>

<p>“Hold off,” he said roughly. “What’s it from you?”</p>

<p>“Flowers for the shore gang,” said Rio, in a high
voice.</p>

<p>The watchman laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh. It’s you, eh?” He passed his hand over the gray
stubble on his chin. “I figured you’d be headin’ south
about this time.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the mate, Watch?” asked Rio, who was now
grinning.</p>

<p>“The same baby they had last trip,” answered the
watchman, spitting abeam of the wind.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Cap,” said Rio. He went through the warehouse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
to the pier and started up the gangplank. A mess-boy,
flour covering his shoulders, cried “Gangway!” Rio
twisted past him, indifferently brushing his sleeve where
the boy had bumped into him. At the top of the plank
Rio called to the quartermaster. “Where’s the mate?”</p>

<p>“Up at No. 2.”</p>

<p>Rio started forward, then turned and went aft to the
last house ’midships. He opened the door of the sailors’
messroom and walked in. A few men were sitting around
the table which was covered with dirty oilcloth. They
were drinking coffee. One of them got up.</p>

<p>“Hello, Rio. I ain’t seen you since you broke your
wrist over the Old Man’s head in the Channel.” The sailor
laughed. “From bridge to brig in one trip.” He rubbed
his head with tattooed fingers while the crimson lady,
dotted on his heavy forearm, danced. The printed line,
<span class="allsmcap">ROTTERDAM GERTIE</span>, under the figure, stretched as wide
as the lady’s hips.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a bad trip, Joe,” answered Rio. “The brig’s
better’n the chainlocker.” He looked suddenly interested.
“How’d the Old Man make out?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. The last I seen him was when we tied up at
Rotterdam. They was packin’ him off down the Lekhaven.”</p>

<p>“Down the Lekhaven, eh?” Rio looked grim. “His
bones’d set of themselves on the Schiedamsche Dyk.”</p>

<p>Joe waved the remark aside.</p>

<p>“What happened to you, Rio?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“They broke me, and let it go at that.”</p>

<p>“No more brass on your shoulders then.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather polish it than wear it.”</p>

<p>“Are you goin’ to ship on this?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Who’s the bos’n?”</p>

<p>“I am. Seventy-five dollars, my own boy and radio.”</p>

<p>“Company man, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I never pass up this chicory.” The bos’n
poured more coffee. “Have some,” he said.</p>

<p>Rio looked around the messroom. He saw the college
boys staring at him, the flies on the wall and a cockroach
settled under the percolator.</p>

<p>“Take it, Joe,” he said. “And my compliments to
B.A.”</p>

<p>The bos’n followed him out of the messroom and
walked beside him on the pier.</p>

<p>“They’re all the same, Rio,” he said, a little sadly.
“The ships, the turnips and the crew. By God!—I won’t
rot on shore, though.”</p>

<p>“I won’t neither,” said Rio. “I’ll go back sometime.”</p>

<p>They were passing a waterfront cafe. Its sign read:
beer parlour. Joe pulled Rio inside and they sat down
at a table.</p>

<p>“We shipped together for a long time,” said the bos’n.
“There’s somethin’ eatin’ you. Drink up and get it off
your chest.”</p>

<p>Rio raised his glass and set it down empty. Joe followed
and waved his red hand at the waitress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“A head on two,” he said.</p>

<p>Rio watched the girl pour the beer.</p>

<p>“I don’t figure it myself, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Drink up. Drink up and get it off your chest.”</p>

<p>“Well, my shipmate, last trip, was a queer one. I don’t
mean there was funny business. I never knew nobody
like him. He wasn’t no sailor, and sometimes I thought
he was a little off. I never felt like that before, and it was
all jam. He didn’t know how to take care of himself; so
when he piled off in New York I knew he was in for it.
I followed him and he was all over the town. He met a
fag who got him a job. Then he met a girl and fell in
love with her. The fag had him fired, and he went off the
deep end. He got drunk and the girl threw him over. I
found him at the Doghouse. I got hold of the fag and
fixed him up a little and went to the girl’s place. And
then—” Rio stopped and looked at the beer.</p>

<p>“Get it off your chest,” said Joe, and the tattooed ring
on his forefinger turned an evil blue in the dim light.</p>

<p>Rio took a deep draught before he spoke.</p>

<p>“You know I ain’t cared for a woman since——”</p>

<p>“I know.” Joe nodded.</p>

<p>“She’s a swell girl,” said Rio, leaning heavily on the
table.</p>

<p>“Who?” Joe looked bewildered.</p>

<p>“Martin’s girl. She’s too good for him. I’d hate to see
her hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>Joe thought a moment.</p>

<p>“What about you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“None of that,” said Rio shortly.</p>

<p>Joe shoved his glass aside.</p>

<p>“Is that all of it?”</p>

<p>“No.” Rio looked glum. “This Roberts—he’s the fag—don’t
like the set-up. I think Martin and the girl’d
make it but for him.” Rio glanced up at Joe earnestly.
“I got him bluffed, though, and as long as I hang around,
he won’t bother no one.”</p>

<p>Joe made a disgusted sound.</p>

<p>“You can’t wet nurse ’em the rest of your life.”</p>

<p>“No, but I could make a short trip and look Roberts
up afterwards.”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head.</p>

<p>“And get thrown in jail? Listen!” Joe leaned closer to
his friend. “Why don’t you ship out, Rio? There ain’t no
use—” But something about Rio’s appearance made him
stop. “All right,” Joe left the table. “If you change your
mind, I’ll be in No. 5.”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Rio, not looking up.</p>

<p>Joe walked back slowly to his ship and Rio drank
coffee. When he left the restaurant he went straight
down the waterfront to the South American Line. A small
ship was sailing for Santa de Marina that evening, for
bananas. Rio saw the first officer.</p>

<p>“I want to get out, Mister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“We don’t like pierhead jumps on the <i>Nancy II</i>” said
the blunt little officer. Then he looked Rio over. “Have
you seen the delegate? Is your gear handy?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Bring it aboard. See the bos’n—Good Jesus, lad!”
the mate yelled to an ordinary seaman who was scrubbing
the whitework. “Soo-gee that bulkhead! Don’t kiss
it!”</p>

<p>Rio was forward when they cast off the lines. After the
ship was made ready for sea he sat down on a bitt and
watched the higher lights of Manhattan fade in the
twilight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XI</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin left Rio’s hotel and walked slowly along
Fourteenth Street. His mind was blended with the darkness
about him, for the street seemed to rest after the
petty trading and rush of the day. He passed the cheap
little shops and solitary stragglers, unconsciously accepting
them in their place; nor did he turn his head to glance
at the thin blue lights of a tiny cinema across the way.
But a girl, in passing, brushed his shoulder lightly and
asked him for a cigarette. He stopped, felt in his pockets
and pulled out a package which he offered her.</p>

<p>“Mentholated, ain’t they?” she said, pleased at her
good luck. “Gee, I like mentholated.” She took one of
the cigarettes and handed back the package.</p>

<p>Martin looked at her and saw the rakish, ill-fitting
dress, the tired expression in her eyes and the affected
smile.</p>

<p>“Won’t you keep them?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mister. That’s swell,” she said, stuffing them
in her bag. “But d’you have any?” Here she hesitated.
“You better have one,” she said at last, carefully selecting
a cigarette and handing it to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>He accepted it and put it in his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>“Not there,” she cautioned. “You’ll smash it. Put it
there.” She pointed to the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>Unthinkingly, he obeyed her.</p>

<p>“Say,” she said, peering at him. “You look hungry.”</p>

<p>“I’m not hungry,” Martin smiled at her. “But now, I
have to hurry.” He smiled at her again, then walked on
rapidly.</p>

<p>The girl kept at his side, looking at him, her mouth
slightly open.</p>

<p>“You’re a nice man,” she said finally.</p>

<p>Martin stopped and looked directly at her.</p>

<p>“If you knew what I am, you’d run like a frightened
cat. You’d run anywhere, and afterwards thank God for
it.” Then, seeing her eyes widen and her fingers clutch
her bag, he continued more gently, “For you are a little
cat, aren’t you, Cat?” and he hastened on with long
strides.</p>

<p>The girl stared after him, then turned, and with her
head hanging down, walked slowly the other way.</p>

<p>As Martin approached Seventh Avenue he noticed a
bright-eyed old woman on the corner. On the pavement
in front of her was a basket of French marigolds. Martin
hesitated and stared at the flowers for a second, then at
the old woman.</p>

<p>“What do they mean?” he asked. “They look like
wax.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, sir, they ain’t. I grew ’em myself.” The old
woman watched him, her hands in her apron.</p>

<p>“Give me a bunch of the prettiest!” Martin pointed.
“There!—in the center. They are for someone I love.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ll give ye the bunch that’s prettiest.” She
chose the freshest ones and carefully wrapped the stems
in a piece of damp brown paper.</p>

<p>“Thanks, old lady,” said Martin, dropping a coin in
her hand. “And I’ll give <em>you</em> a wish.” For a moment she
smiled, Martin thought rather shyly, regarding him with
a strange, toothless understanding. He held the marigolds
before him, sniffing occasionally as he hurried on.</p>

<p class="tb">When Deane saw him she wanted to cry; and taking
the flowers, she fingered the little bouquet lovingly before
laying it aside for a moment.</p>

<p>Martin sat down heavily on the divan.</p>

<p>“My God, I’m tired,” he said. “Tired and hungry.
Why, I’m just as tired as when I left here. That seems
like a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s talk about it,” said Deane, sitting down
beside him. Martin could feel each pulse beating from
her wrist in time with his own blood. He put his head
against her arm, letting the faint sound ring into his temples.
He rested against her naturally, faithfully, as
though returning from a voyage of centuries or death.</p>

<p>Deane added to this dream-like state, this swift advance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
of years to year. She felt the soft wash of logic
crumbling within her, loved him without exception, and
remained quiescent. She heard Martin’s breathing, felt
an awakening, a weary happiness. A clear stream of
words, unintelligible, fell through her hair....</p>

<p>Martin sat up.</p>

<p>“Did you sleep, too?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Deane, smiling. “But I was very
happy. You slept like a baby. Don’t you ever talk in your
dreams?”</p>

<p>“I did have a dream,” declared Martin, now thoroughly
awake. “I dreamt that I met you at the point
where the world meets itself. We decided instantly that
we loved each other and——”</p>

<p>“What a lie!” interrupted Deane, laughing.</p>

<p>“I swear it!” said Martin, elaborately crossing his
heart. “And I dreamt also that I was very hungry.
Wasn’t that strange?”</p>

<p>“Yes. A coincidence,” said Deane, kissing him on the
lips and starting to rise.</p>

<p>Martin caught the back of her hair and strained her
to him.</p>

<p>“Deane!” he cried. But she pushed against his shoulders
until he let her go.</p>

<p>“I’m going to cook some bacon and eggs, Martin,” she
said, panting. “Don’t act that way now. You said you
were hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>“For you,” Martin argued, stretching out his body and
holding out his arms.</p>

<p>Deane shook her head and went into the kitchen where
she could hear Martin laughing.</p>

<p>“He is really a terrible person,” she said to herself.
But her lips trembled, and as she brushed the damp hair
off her forehead the implication in her dark eyes was
delightful.</p>

<p>When she brought in the feast Martin jumped up to
help her with the tray. He could scarcely wait to taste the
coffee.</p>

<p>“It’s perfect,” he said. “And how did you fix the
eggs?”</p>

<p>“I beat them up with a little milk before putting them
in the pan.”</p>

<p>“They’re wonderful,” he repeated. “Let’s make it a
<em>real</em> feast. What do you say we wait up until dawn.
There will be many colors and shapes in the clouds from
this window.” He pointed to where the late moon, a dull,
inverted sickle, was shining in the east. “I can put my
hand outside the window and almost touch Europe,
Deane,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t want Europe,” Deane said huskily. Her face
seemed a little drawn as she watched him, her eyes half
closing and unclosing.</p>

<p>Martin, noting the expression on her face, felt a kind
of loving in his heart which he had never known before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Sweet little maniac,” he said gently, and petted and
caressed her. The sedative movement of his hands, which
he worked most carefully, so as not to excite the blood or
open the tiny nerves about her spine soon quieted Deane
and she lay in his arms. “I’m going to tell you some
stories,” he said, rubbing his cool cheek against hers.
“And later, we’ll watch the dawn come up over Europe.”</p>

<p>It was midnight. The last light had been extinguished
in the giant buildings and only the raw sky and the face
of the radio brought shadow into the room. Deane rested
on the divan, her eyes on Martin who sat crosslegged on
the floor in front of her. Suddenly, he leaned forward.</p>

<p>“This is a magical room, Deane, and this is a magical
night. In older times, in an ancient time, there was a
beautiful Princess—the loveliest in all the world. Arrogant
Princes with long gleaming swords and many
dragons to their credit wooed her. But she was unresponsive.</p>

<p>“Her father, the King, said, ‘She is sick.’</p>

<p>“Her mother, the Queen, said, ‘We shall see.’</p>

<p>“And so, one night, when the moon burned like a silver
flame over the Kingdom, they stood at the wall of her
room and peered through the chinks at their daughter.
The Princess, a look of ecstasy upon her face, was in a
chair, resting. In front of her was a little, old man—perched
like a bird before her....</p>

<p>“‘What does she see in the little man?’ whispered the
King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“‘What <em>does</em> she see?’ demanded the Queen. Affection?
A reflection of herself? Or some quality in the
creature?’”</p>

<p>Martin stopped. Deane’s hands braided and became
sexed again. Once more, Martin leaned forward.</p>

<p>“Would you like to hear the sequel?... It happened
in Paris, Deane. There was a gargoyle struck on the
cornice of a gigantic cathedral. His stone eyes had been
forced shut by the ages and his only tears were rain. His
thick shoulders were bent by the centuries, and moss
covered his throat.</p>

<p>“A beautiful woman, desired by all men, surfeited by
leisure and adoration, saw this figure. And so, in secret,
she took lodging across from the cathedral that she might
watch the shadows move in the gargoyle’s face by moonlight,
by lightning-flash and in sun. Day by day she contemplated
his patient, agonized expression; and day by
day she became more contemptuous of the gracefulness
and vanity of her suitors.</p>

<p>“One night, moonlit and vagaried with cloud, she was
gazing at the asymmetrical face. Suddenly the head
seemed to move. The woman’s heart beat quickly and she
grasped the sides of her chair. Deliberately, while she
watched, the gargoyle’s eyes opened and turned upon her,
asking a question. The woman, protesting, held out her
white hands. At this, the figure shuddered; then his stone
arms pushed on the cornice and his shoulders broke from
the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“The woman ran to her mirror, regarding her pale,
excited face. In her closet she touched her gowns—faster
and faster her heart! Dressing herself in the loveliest
gown of all, she returned in haste to her chair. There she
waited, facing the empty cornice where a gargoyle had
lain for centuries....</p>

<p>“There was a soft sound at her door. Now, through the
opening, the woman could hear quick breathing. She
pressed her hand against her throat, observing the figure
as it entered.</p>

<p>“Slowly the gargoyle went to her, his movement quiet
and purposeful. Laying his head upon his arms, he
dropped down on his knees before her. Frightened, the
woman looked away. Then her love, conquering fear,
placed an infinite pity upon him. Her hands braced
under his chin, lifting the agonized face until his eyes
met hers. Lightly, her fingers caressed the deep cracks in
his cheek, brushed the dry moss from his throat—and
for one helpless, inarticulate moment, the gargoyle
lived.”</p>

<p>Martin felt the heavy wetness of his eyes. His twisted,
passionate face looked up at Deane.</p>

<p>“She knew!” he cried. “And you know!”</p>

<p>Deane placed her hands upon his throat and drew him
toward her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. While in an uneven, throaty voice she
kept repeating, “She knew, and I know.”</p>

<p>“Flower lips,” Martin whispered, the taste of blood in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
his mouth, “squint your lovely eyes like old China—China
eyes—” He moved her then, until she floated, insubstantial,
upon the blue mosque of the couch. Once
more, reality became a dream, and night pushed inward....</p>

<p>Martin watched the moon rise slowly and swing higher
southward. Venus appeared, and then the Dipper, of
such a calculating blue, such measured coldness that
Martin shivered. He looked at Deane tenderly as she lay
in his arms, trying to remember when such emotion had
dominated him. Deane’s face, a cameo in the steel-tinted
light, was now upturned to him in a death-like stillness.
He put his ear against her heart to reassure himself.
Deftly, he disengaged his arm from her waist and slipped
on one knee to the floor. Then he crept softly to the window
and looked out over the vast eastern sky. He imagined
that he could faintly see the first pale ravages of
dawn, so he returned. Still kneeling on the floor, he blew
upon Deane’s hand and up her arm. He thought that she
would never awaken, until suddenly he heard her say,
“My, what a feeling you gave me! Did you enjoy the
view from the window?”</p>

<p>“So you were awake all the time!” Martin laughed.
“I thought as much.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you blow so hard?” asked Deane. “And
why did you sigh once?”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Martin, pulling her to her feet. “The
sky’s beginning to change.” The sunrise was bleak, desolate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
and forbidding. “It just came out of the sea by way
of Newfoundland,” he added. “Everything is cold in that
region—even the sun. Do you see those clouds streaking
over the horizon? That’s the point where all winds leave
for a short visit with Mother Carey.” Martin sniffed the
air. “I thought so. Don’t laugh, Deane, but I can smell
icebergs.”</p>

<p>“What do they smell like?” Deane asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Some sailors say the bergs smell like wet sea moss;
others say it’s like a pocket of cold salt. But to me they
have no positive odor. It’s more like a taste. It’s like
kissing an ammoniated mirror.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” said Deane, looking at him queerly.</p>

<p>The wind outside was raging and whistling through
the radio antennas as through the rigging of a ship.</p>

<p>Deane made fresh coffee. As Martin was finishing his
cup, she asked him gravely, “Martin, how are you going
to live? What will you do?”</p>

<p>He raised his head.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t worry about that, Deane; at least, not
now. I know a typographer who, I think, will give me a
job. It will probably be part time, but that’s all the
better, for I have some other work I’d like to do.”</p>

<p>“What kind of work?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Along the same line,” Martin answered. He pulled an
oilskin envelope from his pocket and carefully took out
some papers. “I’m building a type design that I’ve
worked on quite awhile. As an avocation I find a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
deal of pleasure in it. Some of the letters got a little
wet, but I think you can see what I’m trying to do.” He
spread the papers out on a table and he and Deane bent
over them. He pointed to one of the capital letters. “See,
Deane?—The design is that of living forms—plant and
animal. In the drawing, the bottom circles represent
growth by cell structure in all life. By simply rolling up
this series, beginning with the smallest cell, the face of
the shell is seen, because that is the way shells grow—by
rolling up themselves as they develop. Since the rate
of development is normally the same, the flare of the
sectors is constant.</p>

<p>“The black line of the drawing shows where the artist
places the line for the letter stem, missing the center by
half the radius. The blue line shows where the stem
really should be placed. It looks much better that way.
You will see that the straight line is intersected at an
angle of about 100 degrees instead of the 90 degree
angle.</p>

<p>“On the back of the drawing is seen how this measurement,
‘the square of root 2’ rule, is worked out for rectangular
designs. The square root of 2 is 1.4141 etc.; its
reciprocal, divided by 2, is .707 etc. That is, the strongest
and most beautiful rectangle is 1.7 times as long as
wide. Apply it to a book page. Width is determined
mainly by size of type and number of columns per page.
For a page 6 inches wide the length is 1.7 times 6 or
10.2 inches. This is the correct ‘golden’ or ‘sacred’ sector,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
used almost universally in the temples and sacred vessels.
Textbooks give the page ratios 5 to 8 as the golden
sector but it is not correct, neither is it so convenient or
beautiful as the 6 to 10.2.</p>

<p>“The design is based on the soundest dimensional ratio
known—‘dynamic symmetry.’ Many years were spent recovering
this lost art, mainly in countries about the
Eastern Mediterranean—Greece, Egypt, Persia, Arabia,
and so on. The findings were published in a beautiful
volume<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and it was there I got my information and inspiration
to design a type face.</p>

<p>“It is a humiliating fact that no original type face has
ever been designed in America. Our type designers have
been modifiers of European types, adding what Mark
Twain called ‘new and killing varieties.’”</p>

<p>Martin folded the papers and returned them to the
oilskin envelope. He was absorbed by his subject and
failed to notice Deane’s expression, or her flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of myself, Martin,” she said quietly. “I
didn’t realize that you had such a definite structure running
along with your life. Go on out now and try to get
your job. And when you come back, I’ll have fixed our
dinner.”</p>

<p>When she had tightly buttoned up his coat, he kissed
her as a man would kiss his wife. She detained him for
a second, ran into her bedroom and came out triumphantly
waving a heavy muffler. After she had tied it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
properly around his throat, she threw her arms around
him and sobbed quietly for just a moment. Then she
shook the tears away in happiness, lifted her chin and
gently pushed him through the door.</p>

<p>Martin, expressionless, with a steady tread, faced the
sharp wind outside. He looked at the foot-prints on the
thin film of snow that covered the sidewalks. He smiled.
The passers-by could not tell whether his smile was that
of a child, or of an idiot. He crossed the street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Once, while Deane was living with her aunt in a
midwestern city, she had met a young man named Carol
Stevens who was visiting there. Deane’s aunt liked him—his
little courtesies, the niceties of his behavior. But with
Deane, he produced conflicting impressions. He loved a
kitchen the way most men love a study or an office; and
he moved among the pots and pans the way an artist
walks before his canvas. His talent in bringing common
food to life and giving it new meaning was no greater
than his ability with a needle. He could take odds and
ends of material and bring them together in an evening
gown as fragile as a cloud. But more interesting than
the things he created was his manner of creation; for he
sewed with curving, meticulous gestures that were certain
of each other. Sometimes Deane, watching him,
would smile, and sometimes frown as though puzzled.
After his visit, the young man returned to his home in
Idaho and Deane forgot all about him.</p>

<p>She was having a quiet cup of tea one afternoon when
he announced himself. When he came in he took her
hands affectionately, as though they were long lost and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
newly reunited friends. He placed his topcoat carefully
on a chair, sat down on the divan and pulled his trousers
high above his ankles. In less than a minute he seemed
quite at home.</p>

<p>“What a <em>dreadful</em> trip!” he said. “A simply dreadful
trip, dear!—I’m exhausted. On a bus,” he explained.
“Gas fumes—oranges—babies! A man with a parachute
on his back, or something,” he ended wearily.</p>

<p>Deane laughed. She offered him tea, but he shook his
head vigorously.</p>

<p>“Wine?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Wine,” he repeated, and drew a line across his
fingernail, adding, “—so much.”</p>

<p>Deane went to a cabinet and poured a glassful of
sherry.</p>

<p>Carol looked at the drink and stuck his tongue into it.</p>

<p>“Glorious!” he said, sipping like a kitten. Deane had
the feeling he was going to take off his shoes.</p>

<p>To her relief Martin came in and she introduced the
two men. Carol watched the newcomer suspiciously. He
was shorter than Martin and chunky. He was broad in
the belly; his waistband was spread with fat. His suit,
which was more yellow than tan, accentuated his contour
in spite of its good tailoring. His pale eyebrows lighted
his pale eyes. His nose revolted at the tip and elevated
itself, searching. His mouth was supposed to be prim and
grim; but Martin wondered if he could catch it in a pot.
His chin billowed out. His wrists were thick and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
fingers perky. They touched things lightly. He took a
cigarette holder from his pocket. Three of his fingers
were around the stem and the fourth stuck out. Martin
wondered how it would feel to bite this one off. It gave
him a pleasant sensation to think of having the finger in
his pocket, severed. He was so rapt in his thoughts that
he smiled. This made Deane nervous. It was all right for
Martin to act that way with her, but not with other people.
When he smiled like that with other people it meant he
was taking a trip. She tried to catch up with his thoughts
before they became spectacular.</p>

<p>“Carol had a miserable time,” she said. “It was on a
bus; and there were detours—it’s not pleasant.”</p>

<p>“It’s not pleasant,” repeated Carol.</p>

<p>Martin frowned and looked at him. He looked at Carol
and the more he looked, the more he disliked him. Carol
was shocked at the way Martin was watching him. It made
him uncomfortable and angry. He drew his mouth into a
forced, straight line, tucked in his chin and spoke to
Deane.</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em> wretched, dear. I bounced this way, and I
bounced that way! And my traveling companions!” He
rolled his eyes. “There was a salesman!” Carol snorted;
a delicate snort, neither high nor loud. “The person had
a case that he held on his lap all the way!” Carol’s shoulders
shook with mirth and the ashes from his cigarette
fell on the rug. He stopped for a moment to nibble at his
holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Martin felt something unhealthy—something that hung
in the room like an infectious mist. But the young man
squirmed comfortably and continued.</p>

<p>“There was an old lady. The proverbial old lady of all
busses. The kind that has a basket of food and draws
out apples and fried chicken and the right kind of sandwiches.
She offered one of them to me.” He had made
himself laugh until he felt slightly sick. “And I bounced
this way, and I bounced that way!”</p>

<p>Deane told Carol that it had been an amusing experience,
but one not to be repeated; to which Carol replied
as he raised one plump hand, the palm outward, “Heaven
forbid!”</p>

<p>Deane tried to be pleasant, but she didn’t feel well.
The air was sticky, and she wanted to sit down with
Martin and have him hold her tightly and listen to him
swear for five minutes. Martin could swear so beautifully
that it purified a room like rain.</p>

<p>Martin knew what Deane was thinking and he reached
for her hand. Carol saw this and cleaned his cigarette
holder with a clear, refined disapproval. Then he meticulously
cleaned his ear with the finger Martin wanted. He
cleaned his ear thoroughly; but his movements were
elegant. The expression on his face was Olympian....
He was alone in the room. Then he looked more cheerful.
He was not alone. He was in New York, visiting....
He tried to yawn and couldn’t; but he slapped his
lips lightly and smiled at Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“Deane has a lovely apartment—doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>Martin nodded, but remained silent.</p>

<p>Carol’s mouth became firm again and he tapped the
floor petulantly with the toe of his shoe.</p>

<p>Martin arose, went to a table where there was whisky
and poured himself a drink.</p>

<p>Carol watched him for a moment, then stood up and
took Deane’s hands.</p>

<p>“I have an appointment, my dear,” he said gently. “It
has been good to find you.” He hesitated, lifting one eyebrow.
“And I am happy to have met your friend.”</p>

<p>Martin nodded again and took a drink.</p>

<p>Carol bit his lip and put on his coat, tenderly pressing
a scarf of coral pink under his collar.</p>

<p>“Goodnight. I’ll call you to-morrow, dear,” he said to
Deane as he left.</p>

<p>When the door closed behind him Martin put down
his glass and went over to Deane.</p>

<p>“It’s funny,” he said, “how friendships like this spring
up.”</p>

<p>Deane looked away while she spoke.</p>

<p>“He hates you.”</p>

<p>Martin squinted through the window at the colors in
the dusk.</p>

<p>“Have your fun, Martin,” she continued, “but not at
his expense. Why were you so rude?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s the easiest way.”</p>

<p>“I know Carol’s extravagances,” she went on, “but I
hate to see him hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Martin wheeled around. “And I don’t want you hurt,”
he answered. “Carol’s bad luck. He’s a fool and a parrot.”
Then, raising his voice a little, he repeated,
“They’re all damned bad luck.”</p>

<p class="tb">All this time Carol was walking down the street. His
walk was unusual but convincing. His hips had no vertical
motion. They jerked horizontally, hesitated, and
jerked to the other side. He knew that his hips did this.
He liked it and did it on purpose, for he had always liked
the abstract movement of a woman. So Carol went down
the street, aware and proud of his unusual attraction.
But he kept thinking of Deane and Martin. He shuddered.
“They are like animals—they!” He looked swiftly
at a man crossing the street. Then he shrugged his shoulders
and thought again of Deane and Martin. “How
carnal! How obvious! Why, even now they might be
looking at each other—holding each other.” The thought
was too repugnant and he held a handkerchief to his lips.
Yes; such things were—he waved his handkerchief almost
imperceptively—well, beyond endurance. Gently he
picked up his cross and strapped it over his shoulders,
basking in tribal strength. His friends had said: “Man
and woman?—ah, yes,”—(with a yawn). Carol held the
handkerchief closer.</p>

<p>He walked along the Avenue to Washington Square
and sat down on a bench. A thin, blonde-haired woman
with a pretty face passed him slowly. She thought rapidly,
came back and sat down beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>Carol’s mind was drifting pleasurably. He remembered
a boy in Chicago who could quote poetry beautifully
and whose blue eyes were oriental. The boy’s hands
were so strong that they could crack a walnut; and yet,
they could be so gentle. Carol smiled, a sweet, remembering
smile. The girl on the bench smiled, too. She
thought he was affecting indifference and her interest
increased. But he did not even know that she was there
until she held a cigarette toward him.</p>

<p>“Pardon me. Do you have a match?” she asked.</p>

<p>Carol was taken from his dream. Not entirely. A moment,
a memory, a little beauty remained. But this
slender, light-haired creature had destroyed everything
he felt most closely. He looked at her calmly. He knew
women.</p>

<p>“I do not have a match. I do not smoke.” He looked at
her and she understood. Both had an expression of loathing.
Each typified the thing in the world they disliked
most. The girl stood up. She didn’t know how to tell him
what she felt, but an obscene, contemptuous movement
of her hips sickened him. He looked in the other direction,
praying that she would leave swiftly. It was humiliating....
The evening shadows hid her as she walked
away and Carol tried to reminisce again. But it was no
good. His dreams had gone.</p>

<p>Two boys strolled past him. They were students and
they were talking about books. Their clothes were not
well pressed and they were obviously thinking about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
technicalities. Another boy went by; thin, his hair uncut,
looking straight before him. Several Italian sweethearts,
laughing, holding hands, walked up and down. Carol
watched them with indifference. Two more boys passed,
close together. One of them was handsome. They laughed
musically, and while Carol could hear only a fragment
of their conversation, it made him lonely. Several young
fellows with polo shirts under their coats approached
him; but he was scornful. “Trade! Commercializing
those wretches!”—He flicked it out of his mind with
arrogance.</p>

<p>The moon undressed over the University. It was
slender, strong and white. Carol had seen a boy like that
one time—slim and white and very strong. Carol made
his own standards when he had been hurt enough. The
moon was a boy, dancing for him. Tears were in Carol’s
eyes and he wiped them away austerely. Still the moon
danced before him. There was an animal cry in his throat,
but he would not let it out. He arose and left the park,
went to a telephone booth and called Deane. While he
talked, he held the back of his neck tightly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Deane. Would it be imposing on you if I came
over again for a few minutes?—just for a few minutes
before I go to my hotel?”</p>

<p>Deane was a woman, too, and she felt the quality of
hysteria in his voice.</p>

<p>“Of course you can. I’ll be so glad to see you, Carol.”
“Right away,” he said, and hung up. For a long time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
he stood there, staring blankly at the mouthpiece while
his child-mind spun blankly round its core.</p>

<p class="tb">Deane returned to the living room, sat down beside
Martin and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Jesus Christ!” said Martin, looking at her.</p>

<p>The phone rang again.</p>

<p>“Jesus Christ!” he repeated.</p>

<p>This time it was Roberts. He asked Deane (rather
pleadingly, she thought) if she would see him.</p>

<p>“Martin is here, Roberts,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Please let me speak with him.”</p>

<p>Deane beckoned to Martin, who flung himself out of
the chair a bit impatiently and took the receiver from her
hand.</p>

<p>“You think this is easy,” said Roberts, when he heard
his voice. “It isn’t, Martin. You think I’m wrong, and I
think you are. But that shouldn’t be an issue. Right or
wrong, there is something more important to which we
owe our fidelity.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Ourselves, Martin. Listen! I’ve gone back and forth
over our quarrel and God knows where the origin was, or
worse yet, where the ends are now. Help me find them,
dear boy. Everything is twisted. I can’t sleep.”</p>

<p>Martin rubbed his forehead. There was sincerity in
Roberts’ voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“Everything’s all right, Roberts,” he said at last.
“Come along.”</p>

<p>“Good boy! Good boy!”</p>

<p>Martin could hear a strange, sobbing chuckle.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he repeated. “And Deane wants you
to come, too.” Martin could see Deane incline her head
gently. It was a gesture he loved and of which he was
jealous. After he left the phone they sat for some minutes
without speaking. Then Martin shook his head.
“Jesus Christ!” he said once more.</p>

<p>He got up and went into the kitchen to mix the highballs.
Before he had finished he heard Deane open the
door and knew that it was Carol. The boy stepped across
his brain—walked cozeningly, with his side-weave and
his red, disarranged face. Then Martin heard Roberts.
He felt the unreliable smile—saw the white, fanatical
face. He felt the pressure of entering the room and held
his fingers against the sides of his head. The two figures
with Deane were waiting for him.... Carol, looking
for a lost doll.... Roberts, handsome, leprous, searching
for the impossible.... Martin waited until the
introductions were over, then walked into the living
room with the drinks. He placed the tray of highballs on
a table.</p>

<p>Roberts got out of his chair at once and went to him,
holding out his hand with an intense movement which
Martin accepted quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“You’re looking well again, Martin,” said the adviser.
“And I’m glad to find it so.” He turned halfway to
Deane with a strained smile. “Isn’t it splendid, Deane?”</p>

<p>She returned the smile, nodding her head and Martin
broke in swiftly.</p>

<p>“I fell into a job, Roberts—free lance work that
turned regular. Perhaps my relief shows in my appearance.”</p>

<p>“Where is the job?” asked Roberts quickly, looking
concerned.</p>

<p>“Downtown,” said Martin, a vague expression in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Roberts flushed and returned to his chair, while Martin
sat down on the divan beside Deane. Carol, who had been
watching the two men with fascination, leaned back sighing,
a satisfied look softening his features as he drew out
his cigarette holder.</p>

<p>“I knew New York would be this way—just this way.
And I just <em>love</em> it!” He cocked his head at Martin and
nodded wisely. “The swift pace of commerce,” he added.</p>

<p>“Who said that?” asked Martin, amused.</p>

<p>Carol looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Why, I—why, I think the salesman did. But it was so
apt—the salesman said—” He hesitated, and Martin
raised his hand in agreement.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> apt, Carol,” he replied. “I should know. It takes
experience to make one understand ‘the swift pace of
commerce.’ Mr. Roberts realizes this, too, though in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
different way; for <em>he’ll</em> never let commerce get at <em>his</em>
heels.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I won’t,” said Roberts vehemently. “I’ll follow
it, trip it, mold it and make it carry me.” He was
about to continue when Deane spoke quietly, but with a
certain implied request. Her beautiful eyes gleamed in
the shaded light.</p>

<p>“Did you keep your appointment, Carol?” she asked,
turning to him with mild interest.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” he answered in a puzzled voice. “No, we
must have been—well, mixed up,” he went on more precisely.
“So I went to the park—Washington Square, the
policeman said it was. But oh!—I just felt so blue I <em>had</em>
to call you up.” He held a silken handkerchief daintily
under his nose and let it flutter with his breath. “But
there’s a glorious moon,” he continued, looking at Martin.
“It really seems to be dancing. And speaking of dancing—I
saw the <em>cutest</em> thing at a show the other night!” He
became enthusiastic and stood up, still holding on to the
handkerchief with one hand while he placed the other on
his hip. Then he turned his head a little and looked
coyly over one shoulder.</p>

<p>“What was it like?” asked Deane, a strange smile on
her lips.</p>

<p>“I really can’t say, dear. But,” Carol’s eyes brightened,
“It <em>did</em> have—” he waved the handkerchief, “what do
you call it?—‘um-pah!’” Completely forgetful now of
his surroundings, he pursed his lips into a curious form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
and began to sing in a rather wistful mood, “Ooh-ooh,
woo-woo, me too,” his hand on his hip, his handkerchief
still fluttering. Then he circled his left foot back of the
right, followed up, and continued until he was moving
gracefully across the room in time with the weird intonation.
At last he seemed to fade into the hallway as
though it were the wings of a theater; and the three in
the room could hear the words float in long after he had
disappeared—“Ooh-ooh, woo-woo, me too.”</p>

<p>Martin laughed without restraint and clapped his
hands loudly. There was a gurgle of delight from the
hall and Carol peeped around the doorway, his face
aglow at such acclaim.</p>

<p>“Great!” continued Martin, as the young man came in
beaming. “The best! The very best, Carol!” he went on,
while the other, breathless, sat down and touched the
handkerchief to his forehead. Deane’s eyes still gleamed
peculiarly; but Roberts had merely turned his face the
other way.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as though each wanted to convince the
others that his own thoughts were spontaneous, they
talked in animated sequence. They talked of music, and
of tides, and of the government. Each word was a word—Roberts’,
like a dark sword in a silver lake; Carol’s, like
the hole in a fisherman’s net; and Martin’s and Deane’s,
like clouds over a river.</p>

<p>In a short while, Roberts stood up.</p>

<p>“I must go,” he said gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>Carol got up also, and after a brief look at Martin,
followed the adviser into another room to get his coat.</p>

<p class="tb">Outside there was a cool wind blowing. Carol led
Roberts to Washington Square—an inexplicable impulse
returning and behind the direction. The guards had raked
the grass after the early snows. A pile of leaves burned
slowly, and the soft flutter of pigeons beyond the firelight
made the park seem homely and comfortable. On the icy
concrete surrounding the fountain there were children
with skates. Their flashing feet splintered the dark which
lay under the moon, and around these romping figures
the cool wind, blowing softly, held everything together.</p>

<p>Neither Carol nor Roberts noticed the pigeons or the
children. They were watching their own hearts. Carol’s
beat slowly, with a regular, bovine thump. Roberts’ beat
quickly, irregularly, with acuity and despair. He was in
such despair that he tried to find camaraderie within the
boy beside him. His monologue pretended to be a conversation,
but his bright words of indictment against
Martin rolled across Carol’s porcine cheek and were reflected,
turning in to himself, weighting his bitterness
more heavily.</p>

<p>“Yes, Carol,” he said, “we must forget ourselves in
this issue. We must save our friends from this domestic
suicide. Clutching an insane illusion of love, they are
bemused by carnal appetite. Lost on the horizon of flesh,
their perspective becomes astigmatic. Drowned in beast’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
blood, they deliberately blind themselves to an obvious
incompatibility. It is our duty to our strength, our lives,
our God, to break this union.” Roberts’ mouth became
loose and wet. “We must show them the truth....
Martin! Martin!” The adviser’s eyes were like those of a
sick horse. “Martin is so young—so fruitful. We must
forgive him.... And that lovely woman—upset so
terribly by him—we must give her our strength.” Roberts
dropped his head, unable to speak further.</p>

<p>Carol smiled vacuously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p>And while Roberts cried into the vacant moon the boy
beside him, uncomprehending, drooled on.</p>

<p>“Yes. We must give our strength. We must give ourselves.
We must give—” Carol’s voice became fainter
and disappeared into the sound of leaves. He could feel
Martin’s arm around him, petting—forcing. Carol’s face
became curiously beautiful.... He was giving himself....</p>

<p>Roberts, taken from his sadness by this incoherent
dribbling—Roberts, sensing the thought beside him,
moved away. He looked at Carol, at the fat thighs, the fat
cheeks, the desire; and he was suddenly sick. To have
Martin touched, even in thought, was unbearable. Unsteadily
he pushed himself off the bench and walked
away without speaking. The moon was beautiful, but it
was not for him. There was magic in the wind, but it
made him feel more lonely.... For a long time he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
walked. The cornstalk he had left sitting on the bench
was but a mild irritant now. It became less and less so
until Roberts laughed.</p>

<p>Carol was not aware of the change. He knew only that
Martin was closer—that his dream was real.</p>

<p>The bonfire had long been extinguished and the guards
had left. There was no sound of skates; there was a hush
of wings; and the moon looked down on the Italian
lovers with their quick, dark hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XIII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Carol did not sleep well that night. He had dreams
of strong and muscular things; but they felt good. Early
in the morning his child-mind was tired. His fantasies
and adult body had exhausted him. He awoke and
turned over to be spanked. His father had always spanked
him when he had been bad. But now he did not feel his
father’s calloused hand against him, nor could he see his
father’s frown and long, unshaven jaw. Carol turned
over again, realizing vaguely where he was.... His
father was dead. He was not being spanked. Something
had been taken from him and his mouth trembled....
The strong nostalgia made him sick. He wanted to be bad,
and then feel the hard hand and weep happily as his
father struck him.</p>

<p>Carol was now fully awake. He got out of bed, rubbing
his sticky eyes. Over the wash-basin there was a
mirror in which he saw himself. He turned on the cold
water, dipped his head in the bowl and rubbed his cheeks
until they glowed. Then he bathed with a washcloth and
afterwards, squirted toilet water under his arms. The
hotel room was small and hot. He opened the window a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
little wider, returned to his bed and made it up carefully,
patting the corners. At last, he put on a dressing gown
with long, flowing sleeves, smiled at the reflection of his
pink, clean face in the mirror and picked up the telephone.</p>

<p>“Give me outside,” he said.</p>

<p>“What number do you want?” asked the operator,
sucking her teeth.</p>

<p>Carol was startled. Then he gave the number.</p>

<p>Deane answered a little sleepily.</p>

<p>Carol lit a cigarette and blew the smoke in flat, blue
layers.</p>

<p>“Did I get you out of bed, sweet?”</p>

<p>Deane smiled easily, the smooth skin at the corners of
her eyes forming tiny lines.</p>

<p>“Of course not, Carol,” she replied. “I’m glad you
called. Did you enjoy your evening with Mr. Roberts?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Carol, “I had <em>such</em> a good time. Mr.
Roberts is so interesting. And we talked about so many
things. It was such a beautiful evening and so—” Carol’s
sibilant words came through the wire to Deane, awakening
her thoroughly. “Let’s have lunch together,” he continued.
“How about twelve, at the Astor?”</p>

<p>“I have some shopping to do,” she answered, “but I’ll
be through by one. Suppose we make it then.”</p>

<p>“All right, dear. I’ll see you then,” he said, stressing
every other word. “I’ll see you then. Good-by, dear.”</p>

<p>Deane left the apartment in confusion, half amused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
and yet severe. Her tiny hat, which was like an autumn
leaf, revoked the tailoring of her rust-colored velvet suit.
On the street, old women smiled at her without knowing
why; and newsboys became quiet for one starry-eyed,
adolescent moment as she passed. But she kept thinking
of Martin. She remembered him as he had been on the
previous night. She loved him, but he was a problem. If
his were artistry, it would be good to get back to solidity
and minds that ran in clear, straight lines. She had
thought this as she left the apartment. But in the shops
she changed her mind. She saw strong, competent men
and women and she liked them. But thoughts of Martin
persisted—Martin with his hair sticking up—Martin,
fumbling with design and people and dreams. He might
find it! He <em>must</em> find it! Deane put her small, gloved
hand to her throat. She wanted him suddenly, strongly.
She wanted his incoherent sentences, his slippery body
and his crazy, adoring heart. She laughed self-consciously
in front of the pencilheads, typewriter-heads
and blotting-paper faces, and made a few reckless purchases.</p>

<p>Carol met her at precisely one o’clock. His face was
pink, natty and smiling. His belted coat showed his
figure and he wore no hat. His astonishing scarf had
been replaced by an ascot tie whose vivid background
was accentuated by purple stripes. He took both of
Deane’s hands with sisterly affection, completely unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
of the mild attention he had attracted in the
lounge.</p>

<p>“A <em>dreadful</em> morning,” he said wearily. “One can’t
eat in New York, can one?”</p>

<p>Deane was a little piqued.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, biting her scarlet underlip, “one’s
going to.” More kindly she took his arm. “We’re going
to eat heartily, Carol. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>They went into the bar. The buttons on Carol’s topcoat
stuck out like feathers. He was conscious now of the
atmosphere and of the woman with him. His exuberance
spilled, porridge-like, over the barren years of his life
and reached out toward the other patrons in the bar.
Ostentatiously, he led Deane past a table where two elderly
ladies were having whisky and soda. One of them
wore three wedding rings. The other’s plume on her tiny
hat colored the dark fur over her shoulders. Carol’s
good nature manifested itself again and he nodded intimately
to them. The old ladies looked at each other
and went on drinking their whisky.</p>

<p>At last, Carol selected a table and held a chair for
Deane. She wanted a glass of sherry, but tried to enjoy
the drink he ordered. It was a fragile looking concoction
of pale pink, with a lace of foam.</p>

<p>“At home, we call it a ‘raspberry kiss,’” said Carol
proudly.</p>

<p>Deane knew that he thought he was living. He sipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
on, and sang on, hesitating briefly to glance at every
man who walked into the bar. One or two of them looked
at him in amused recognition, but most of them were
absorbed in other matters and passed him, unnoticing.
As the alcohol sifted through his mind, his sentences became
more vapid, more pretentious, and louder. He
began to simper—call attention to unimportant things.
There was an angry moment with the waiter, who accepted
his ridiculous complaints with thinly veiled contempt.
It was difficult to embarrass Deane—the outside
of Deane. But she refused a second drink, suggesting
food instead, and together they went upstairs to the dining
room.</p>

<p>The head waiter courteously guided them to a corner
table. No one was close to them and Deane relaxed. Carol
sighed, lit a cigarette and ordered the luncheon. Suddenly
he leaned toward Deane.</p>

<p>“We have been friends too long, dear,” he said, “for
me to mince words. You don’t mind my speaking?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Deane. “I don’t mind at all.”</p>

<p>“I have heard rumors,” said Carol, shaking his head
over his plate. “They have bothered me and I feel that
you ought to know.”</p>

<p>Deane looked amused.</p>

<p>“Rumors?” she repeated. “Honestly?”</p>

<p>“This,” said Carol sternly, “is not a frivolous joke. It
has no frivolity.” He looked less stern now. Frivolity. He
liked that word. He leaned back in his chair and tried,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
ineffectually, to blow a smoke ring. “This,” he continued,
“concerns your happiness. It will probably hurt you. But
I know you will face it. I must forget myself in this
issue.”</p>

<p>“Issue?” asked Deane, frowning a little.</p>

<p>“Yes, Deane,” went on Carol. “It’s Martin and you.
It is domestic suicide. I watch you clutch this insane
illusion of love—bemused by carnal appetite. Lost on
the horizon of flesh, your perspective becomes astigmatic.
Drowned in beast’s blood, you deliberately blind yourself
to an obvious incompatibility. It is my duty to my
strength, my life, my God, to break this union.” He let
his head rest against the wall for a moment, hypnotized
by the magnificence of his words.</p>

<p>Deane was now frankly amazed. Where did these
words come from? They were brilliant, hateful words.
Carol was incapable of such expression. She hunted
through her memory for the explanation. Then she recalled
Martin’s analogy of the parrot. Carol had heard
the words and had remembered them. Where had he
heard them? No one knew Martin—ah! The good friend
Roberts. That sounded like Roberts. That <em>was</em> Roberts.</p>

<p>She watched Carol—his eyes closed, three fingers on
his holder. Retentiveness—that was it. Carol, the parrot.
Retentiveness. Carol did not know what had broken from
his memory. Deane knew that he believed it was himself
speaking. She began to fear Roberts. Fear him so much
that she forgot Carol was with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>Carol squinted and nodded his head approvingly. That
had done it. His great understanding had brought Deane
to her senses. Her face showed it—pale, constricted.
Carol cocked his flat, moist hands at her in sympathy.</p>

<p>“I know it’s hard,” he said, reaching womanishly toward
her.</p>

<p>Deane did not move away from him, but she had an
odd feeling. Once, she had had a dream that had given
her the same sensation. She dreamed that in an adventurous
moment she had descended to the bottom of the
ocean, there to play with the mermaids, look at the starfish,
and perhaps start a flirtation, harmless or otherwise,
with friendly old Poseidon. She had dropped softly to
the sands of the sea and it was more beautiful than she
had expected. The water was the kind of blue pretty
girls like in nightgowns. It was cool and restful and it
felt good around her legs and her waist. She walked
slowly and gracefully over the white sand and through
the blue water. At last she saw a rock, half-embedded in
moss; and there, holding it tightly, was her starfish. She
knelt down to look at it. It was a large one of delicate
yellow—not at all like those dried, smelly things she had
studied at school. It was yellow, and it clung to the green
moss. It seemed to be in love; but it was quiet. Deane
knew it was asleep when she looked closer. Its crisp
points were symmetrical and straight. Deane blushed,
and through the twilight blue of the water the color of
her cheeks was attractive to King Poseidon who had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
peeking at her through a wall of seaweed. He was infatuated.
She was different from Amphitrite. He loved Amphitrite—her
long green hair, her white face and jeweled
hips. Nevertheless, he wanted to kiss this strange woman.
He wanted to kiss the color in her cheeks and touch her.
But King Poseidon shook his head. Amphitrite could be
very difficult if she became angry. Confound these appetites
for rare and inedible dishes! Poseidon smiled
though, a boyish, sheepish, proud smile. He had appetites.
He was getting to be a little gray; and still, he had
appetites. He looked at Deane once more, wistfully, and
took his appetites to Amphitrite.</p>

<p>Amphitrite combed his beard. Poseidon looked at her
and poked his finger at her and winked. She regarded
him suspiciously, but when she saw the expression in his
eyes something happened to her. Through the darkening
blue her white cheeks softened, became pink and sent out
threads of coral. Poseidon shook his head in wonderment
and happiness. It was just what a man wanted. That was
all. The memory of Deane faded from him as Amphitrite,
her face still coral, gently removed his crown.</p>

<p>As the water became darker, Deane’s dream became
less happy. She couldn’t compete with green hair, a white
face and those commanding, jeweled hips. She was despondent.
She didn’t want King Poseidon. She wanted
the earth again and stars and a warm, comfortable hand.
It was the didactic part of her spoiling a beautiful
dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>Some dreams can’t be shut off. As she drifted toward
the surface of the water a white shadow crossed above her
and twisted under her face. Its white was not a pure
white, and there were dark objects fastened to its shoulders.
Deane wasn’t afraid. The creature didn’t want her.
It didn’t have any sense; but it was close and revolting.
In her dream she floated slowly upward. She was strong
and disdainful, but that didn’t push the creature from
her. She rose slowly, grimly, with hate—motionless. Her
hair caught the surface of the water. Stars poured into
her eyes, the white shadow faded, and she awakened.
She had gone into the bathroom and washed her teeth.</p>

<p>In the dining room Deane remembered this dream and
her feeling for the snub-faced shadow. Carol leaned toward
her. She did not fear him. She did not move from
him, but she wanted clean air and a chance to brush her
teeth.</p>

<p>“Carol,” she said, “Martin and I are very good friends.
I believe in him.”</p>

<p>Carol lit another cigarette. He was bewildered. It was
unfair. He had gone to Deane as a pal. He had tried to
help her. His eloquent monologue still boomed within
him. Then a friendly sorrow for himself killed some of
the pain. He had done his duty although it had been unappreciated.
He saw women—all womankind rotating
under the phallic thumb of bestial domination. He shivered,
reached for the check and stood up. Deane noticed
that he left no tip for the waiter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>She hurried home and Carol returned to his hotel. He
sat carefully on the edge of his bed and looked out at
the moving cars and people. His face was serious. Deane
needed him. His affection would win over this—this—he
put his head down on the pillow and refused to think
any more.</p>

<p class="tb">Deane glanced at the clock. Only an hour to wait.
She was glad that Martin was coming at five. She was
glad to get out of her tailored clothes and into the bath.
It would be comfortable to feel her skin against the
warm porcelain; to smell the soap and to watch the steam
cover the glass. There was no aroma from the step-ins
dropped upon the tile. Only the faint resonance of a discriminate
healthiness from the underclothes was in the
corner. Deane slipped into the tub, still wearing her brassiere
and her wristwatch. Impatiently she took them off
and now, she lay flat across the shoulders of the tub.
Reaching around, with her eyes closed, she felt the cake
of soap next her hips. She weighed it in her hands for an
absent moment, thinking of Martin, and with a slow smile
laid the bar upon one breast, which she had candidly
lifted out of the water. The pride she held in her own
body seemed an important thing to her and she constantly
soaped the skin around her nipple in amusement—but
laved it also, in possibilities too far to speak of, even to
herself. At last the warmth of the bath claimed her more
expressively than she had believed it could; and she remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
with a shiver, the snows of childhood and
buried herself again in the heat of the tub. One of her
hands went gently, but shockingly to her knee; and again
with a smile, not understandable, she lifted her body out
of the water, which rang in constant drops of different
colors from her naked throat.</p>

<p>While she dressed, she thought of her earrings. She
chose a slender East Indian pair of beaten silver. They
were long, nearly touching her bare shoulders, and of a
deceptive quietness. She looked at her slippers—gold,
vermilion, rust—at last selecting ones of purple from
which she decided her gown. Its bodice, which she laced
and tied, peasant fashion, closed tightly about her waist.
The skirt swung slowly from her hips. She looked once
more into the mirror and fastened her hair on one side
behind her ear.</p>

<p>When Martin came, he put his arms around her, kissing
her earrings and her throat, the scented smooth hollow
under her arm, pressing her so close to him that she
trembled.</p>

<p>“Tell me—what did you do to-day?” he whispered,
holding her hand to his cheek.</p>

<p>“I went shopping,” she said. “And later, I had lunch
with Carol.”</p>

<p>Martin spoke irritably.</p>

<p>“That one again? Why doesn’t he go back to the Dust
Bowl?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“He isn’t that bad, Martin.” Deane tried to sound convincing.</p>

<p>“I should think,” Martin said bitterly, “that you would
be the last one to question my judgment where such people
are concerned.”</p>

<p>Deane lifted her delicate eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m your sweetheart,” she said. “That remark
would sound curious to others.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would,” replied Martin, a bit unhappily.
“I’ll admit, I’m prejudiced as the devil, but I can’t
help but see it. Carol’s learning new tricks. The crust is
breaking. He lives among his fantasies—dreams fired
by sagebrush and loneliness. His desire is volatile and
his friends right now may affect the nature of his entire
life. I’m sorry Roberts is mixed up in it.”</p>

<p>Deane was thoughtful for a moment. She cupped her
chin in her hands and drew her small, slippered feet up
under her.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right, Martin,” she observed at last.
“For the first time I see that it’s a dangerous combination.
I still believe, though, that Roberts is the one who,
ultimately, will try to harm you. He’s done it once and
although you came out, he will try it again. He seems to
know your vulnerable points.”</p>

<p>Martin sounded a little angry.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we just eliminate them?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t quite so simple as that, Martin,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Deane. “Roberts and I have mutual friends. I’d always
be running into him. As for Carol—he has no one; and
I couldn’t bear to hurt him.” Deane stared before her.
“Besides,” she added, “I’m wondering if elimination
could bring about anything but superficial results. Roberts
is ingenious.” She turned to Martin impulsively and
put her hand upon his arm. “Martin!—somehow, I don’t
know how—but somehow, Roberts will strike at us!”</p>

<p>In the city light, in the dusk, Deane’s eyes were wide,
as though some new and frightening thought had crossed
her mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XIV</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Rio left the bitt on which he had been sitting. He
crossed the deck and walked down the ladder as the sea
caught the ship and sent her rolling in long swells toward
the Gulf Stream. He was going to his bunk when a man
with a blue chin and hard, bloodshot eyes got up from
the table where he had been drinking beer and went to
him.</p>

<p>“Where’s your book?” the man said abruptly, in a
high, angry voice.</p>

<p>“That ain’t no way to ask for it,” Rio said slowly.</p>

<p>The sailors’ delegate swore.</p>

<p>“Break out that god-damned union book!”</p>

<p>“You’ll find it under this,” said Rio, rubbing his fist.</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s it!” said the delegate, coming closer, unconscious
that his lips were still moving.</p>

<p>“Sure,” continued Rio. “A chink in the Celebes told
me wisdom came with lost teeth.”</p>

<p>“Get wise then!” yelled the delegate, and swung hard.</p>

<p>Rio ducked, but the blow caught him across the jaw
and a little blood ran down his neck. For an instant, his
face was the outlawed Baptist’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“Turn in,” he said, almost in a whisper. “The next
time you might fall.”</p>

<p>The man swung again and Rio drove a wide fist
straight into his face. Blood squirted out all over, covering
both men. The delegate fell backwards; his head
struck a stanchion. He rocked slowly and fell loosely
sideways, his shoulder hitting the deck. Rio stepped over
to the table and picked up the empty beer bottle.</p>

<p>“My God!” said one of the men. The rest of the crew
turned the delegate’s face over. They couldn’t see the
features. They talked among themselves quietly for a
moment, then walked menacingly toward Rio. He jumped
like a monkey into a corner, with the bottle in his left
hand and his right fist cocked. He had pulled off his
skivy-shirt and the men looked at his chest. It was brown
and curiously bare. There was the mark of a slice bar
and a dent across his ribs. They had never seen anything
like it. They stopped and seemed to smell the
blood. Suddenly they recognized the man—his style of
fighting, the way animals do, without thought or compassion.
Rio stood there, silent, massive, and the men
went back to their bunks.</p>

<p>The able-bodied seamen carried the delegate into the
washroom and started working on him. Rio put the bottle
back on the table. Then he took his bucket and towel
into the washroom. He didn’t look at the huddle in the
corner, or at the delegate crying softly on a bench, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
hear an occasional curse from one of the sailors. He
took his bath and returned to his bunk, turned in and
stared at the overhead. He could feel the slow roll and
sudden pitch of the ship. He loved it and felt at home
again....</p>

<p>There were swift movements in the dark around him.
Then the main light in the fo’c’sle came on and it was
quiet for a moment. He could hear a man cough.</p>

<p>“Is he?”</p>

<p>Another voice.</p>

<p>“Yeah. He’s dead.”</p>

<p>And still another.</p>

<p>“Let’s tell the mate on watch.”</p>

<p>“And have your gear turned inside out, you fool?”
said the first voice.</p>

<p>“You’d look funny in the commissioner’s office, too,”
answered the third.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake then, pipe down and let’s drop him
to Davy. I can’t stand him in here. We’ll say he got
drunk ashore and when he came in he fell on his face.
He said his head ached and went on deck. We looked
for him an hour.... I go to the second mate. He’ll
soon be on watch. I tell him the story. Before he gets aft
or calls the Old Man, you have the fo’c’sle cleaned and
the beer hid. Stick by the story. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“What about the fellow who done it? He’ll be on watch
with the second.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“That guy ain’t human. He won’t show nothin’. O.K.?”</p>

<p>“O.K.”</p>

<p>Rio heard the noise die down and went to sleep.</p>

<p class="tb">Rio felt his arm being shaken. He saw a figure bent
over him, wearing oilskins which glistened from a flashlight.</p>

<p>“Seven bells,” said the figure. “Coffee on the boatdeck.
Watch it goin’ ’midships. She’s takin’ a few seas.”</p>

<p>Rio dressed silently, pulled on his sea boots and
fastened his oilskins and sou’wester. On deck, he
looked around the lee corner of the house and waited for
a sea to break over. A small one came under the rail
and hissed across the deck, winding up with a crash
against the hatches. The white water ran into the scuppers.
As she started to roll back, Rio ran as fast as he
could to a ladder to the boatdeck. Then he went forward
to a small house where a light was burning.</p>

<p>In there was a young man pouring coffee. His face
was white and anxious. When he saw Rio he said, “They
tell me you’re my watch partner.”</p>

<p>Rio smiled and nodded his head. He poured himself
a cup of coffee and sat down to drink it.</p>

<p>The young man spoke again.</p>

<p>“I was told to report for lookout duty on the port side
of the bridge. I don’t know where that is.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“But what do I do as lookout?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“Ask the man you relieve,” said Rio. “And don’t be
upset if the mate yells a bit. It’s hard for some of ’em
to fasten a twelve-inch neck in a seventeen collar. Just
lay low unless you see a ship comin’ up. Then tell it to
him as best you can and let him swear all he pleases. We
better go up now,” he added.</p>

<p>They went out into the wind and up the ladder to the
bridge. The quartermaster, seeing Rio, left the wheel.</p>

<p>“One ninety-five,” he said. “One ninety-five,” he called
to the third officer in the chartroom. The officer counted
out the numbers and the quartermaster left.</p>

<p>The second mate entered the chartroom, relieving the
third officer.</p>

<p>Rio saw the ship was on her course and looked out
where his watch partner was walking hesitatingly toward
the wheelhouse. He waved him back.</p>

<p>Soon, the second mate came in without speaking. He
looked at the compass under the binnacle light. Then
he stood up and silently regarded Rio, who gave the
wheel a spoke or two. The mate became exasperated. He
walked up and down, staring out of the glass. Suddenly
he came over and looked at the compass again.</p>

<p>“You’re off six degrees. Heading this way, we might
make Jamaica.”</p>

<p>“I had a wife there once,” said Rio, his face impassive.
“It’s a good island.”</p>

<p>“Wife! You said—‘wife’?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Up in the hills. She was a good worker, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>The mate lit a cigarette. It was twelve-thirty and Rio
struck one bell. Attentively, the officer waited for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>“Where’s that god-damned lookout?” He fastened his
pea-jacket and went out on the bridge. Rio could hear
voices through the wind and shrugged his shoulders.
After awhile, the second mate came back puffing.</p>

<p>“A fine lot—a fine lot to work with!” he said.</p>

<p>A seaman stepped inside the wheelhouse and addressed
the mate.</p>

<p>“There’s a man missin’, sir.”</p>

<p>“A man missing—a man missing? What do you mean?
What happened?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. The sailors’ delegate got drunk ashore. He
was a little foggy and fell on the deck. He didn’t seem
to mind and said he’d take a little air topside. When he
didn’t come down we went up and looked around.”</p>

<p>“Mother of Christ!” cried the second mate. “Break
out the crew—No!” He recalled the man. “I’ll get the
skipper.” He ran out of the wheelhouse, his jacket open.</p>

<p>The man who had reported the accident looked at Rio.
Rio’s face was dark and kindly from the glow of the
binnacle light.</p>

<p class="tb">Several nights later they passed the Gulf Stream and
when Rio got up about eleven in the morning he saw the
deep-purple waters of the Caribbean Sea. It was getting
warmer. He put on clean dungarees and went to the
sailors’ mess for a plate of soup. He could tell little from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
the expression of the men around him, but rather, felt
their sullen disapproval and was indifferent to it. He
ate his soup, asked for another plateful, ate it and went
up to the wheelhouse again. He had been steering for
about five minutes with the second mate beside him when
the latter went out of the house. Rio could hear him climb
the ladder to the flying bridge to check the compass.
When he came down, he walked in front of Rio and
closed the door on the weather side, although it was hot
already. He came back, looked at the compass and smiled
a peculiar smile. Suddenly, there was a sharp noise and
a saccharine odor and the second mate, still smiling,
went out on the lee side of the bridge.</p>

<p>Rio held his nose.</p>

<p>“A virgin,” he said to himself, leaving the wheel and
throwing open the door.</p>

<p>The mate returned and brought the door to. A curious
expression was on his face; but he still smiled as he left
once more for the bridge.</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> fish was picked up in Nagasaki,” said Rio aloud,
and opened the door again.</p>

<p>The second mate slammed the door this time, standing
by the wheel only a moment before wind cracked
at his heels. Rio could see his tiny, blond mustache jump
in the sunlight. But this time, Rio did not open the door.
He followed the mate and stood beside him.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake! Get back to that wheel, you damned
fool!” yelled the officer.</p>

<p>“Not till both doors are open and the weather’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
cleared,” said Rio in an even voice. He leaned on the
rail, his fine eyes glistening.</p>

<p>The second mate rushed into the house where the
wheel had turned until the ship was twenty degrees off
her course. Nervously, but with a calculated deliberation,
he gave her a few spokes at a time, trying to protect himself
from the captain’s eternal damnation. After awhile
Rio walked past him, opened the weather door and took
over. Neither man spoke until Rio was relieved.</p>

<p>The next day Rio was chipping spots on the deck when
he felt a knee against his side. He pulled off his goggles
and looked up. It was the second mate. Rio laid down
his hammer and said, “I can hear.”</p>

<p>“You can hear—what?”</p>

<p>“I can hear trouble if that’s the way you wake me up
again.”</p>

<p>The mate grew excited.</p>

<p>“Listen! What’s the matter with you? Don’t you know
discipline?”</p>

<p>Rio got up. He didn’t say anything but his heavy brown
face looked down with contempt.</p>

<p>The officer tried to retain his dignity.</p>

<p>“Why did you raise hell in the wheelhouse?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Rio continued to look down at him.</p>

<p>“Because I’m a quiet-livin’ man. I’m modest. And I
don’t like to be intimate.”</p>

<p>The second mate’s face turned red.</p>

<p>“Show me your union book,” he said briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>Rio shook his head.</p>

<p>“That’d be too intimate. You don’t carry your school-ship
papers all the time, do you?”</p>

<p>“By God!” shouted the mate. “I’ll have you thrown in
the brig. It’s hot in the forepeak.”</p>

<p>Rio grinned, a slow, malicious grin.</p>

<p>“And there’s dark nights and twenty-foot shark in the
Gulf of Darien—a hell of a place for a snotty little mate
to slip.”</p>

<p>The officer walked away. His eyes seemed red in the
sun and he seemed to be thinking.</p>

<p>Rio adjusted his goggles and went to work. He liked
to see each rusted, brown flake disappear under the blows
of his hammer and uncover the bright blue steel below.
Suddenly, once more, he felt a knee against his side. The
mate had come back. He ordered Rio to move over to the
port side and chip rust near the fishplate. Rio crossed the
deck, watching from the corner of his eye the vicious
look of the officer who was crawling into No. 2 hatch.
Rio grinned again.</p>

<p>“A good place for ’im if a freak wave shifts the
cargo,” he thought.</p>

<p>He had worked for an hour when he heard men shouting.
The captain came down and ran aft, then back to the
fore deck. Seeing Rio at work he hurried to him.</p>

<p>“Have you seen the second mate forward?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. About an hour ago. He told me to chip rust
by the fishplate,” answered Rio.</p>

<p>The captain looked puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“By the <em>fishplate</em>? Quick, man!—was that the last you
saw him?”</p>

<p>“That’s the last, sir.”</p>

<p>“Put her about!” the captain shouted up at the bridge.
“See that a boat’s ready.”</p>

<p>The ship had just swung round when the second mate’s
head appeared above the hatch. He blinked in the sunlight.
His shirt was torn, his flashlight was crushed and
he had a skinned right arm. He limped slowly toward
the captain.</p>

<p>“I was just checking the cargo, sir,” he said. He
turned angrily toward Rio. “I know that man saw me
go down.”</p>

<p>The captain addressed his officer severely.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you on the bridge, Mr. Birch? Do you
check cargo on your own watch?—And with a beam sea
like this running?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” answered the mate, looking away.</p>

<p>“Go and clean yourself up, Mr. Birch.” The captain
turned to speak to Rio, but the steady blows of the chipping
hammer were sounding by the fishplate.</p>

<p class="tb">Rio was standing outside the galley on the <i>Nancy II</i>
when she steamed along the South American coast into
the harbor of Santa de Marina. Once before, when he
had entered the bay, it had been night; and there, tucked
at the feet of the Andes, the town was obliterated by the
proximity of the moon. This time, by day, he knew that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
nature had sustained a lasting brilliance to endure
around the many-colored houses—beyond, the olive
shade of mountain; and before, the whitest line of sand
between the elbows of the cliff that closed upon a canvas
of blue harbor. Lesser energies surrendered in an
atmosphere of light that dominated cooler tones.</p>

<p>It was late morning and Rio saw the ancient, Spanish
town suspended. Soon it would be siesta time—a quiet
drink and heavy sleep while native children watched the
ship and languorously ate their fruit. Rio did not know
he had the same pure look of indolence. The shore’s
breath and the sound of hidden insects were leeward to
the ship; but Rio recognized them all. This was a town
so close to him with heat and spiced, familiar odors, its
bright mantle turned away the thoughts of other things.
New York—its equidistant problems that changed with
unexpectedness—was left behind, or so he felt; and just
before him was a point of tropics with a sweet demand
he understood.</p>

<p>As the <i>Nancy II</i> came alongside the banana docks she
pulled up aft of another ship of about the same tonnage.
The letters on her stern spelled <i>Swamp Rat</i>.</p>

<p>Rio ran forward to help with the lines. The gangplank
was lowered and he went back to the fo’c’sle to wash up.
Later, he saw the first mate, spoke with him and went
down the gangplank into the heavy glare of the sun.
Longshoremen were already unloading No. 4 hatch and
the banana machine was being set up. A large gang of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
peons waited patiently to go to work. A sad-faced one with
a skin of pure black saw Rio looking at them. He smiled
suddenly, and from his squatting position jumped six
feet in the air, clicking his bare heels together rapidly
and coming down on one foot, his ragged trousers flapping.
The rest of the peons clapped and laughed, shoving
each other. But the black was watching Rio; and when
Rio smiled, the black clapped louder than all the rest.
Then quickly, as though he had just thought of it, he ran
to a stack of freshly-cut bananas of a lizard-green. Seizing
a huge bunch from the pile, he tossed it in the air
and Rio, moving nearer, could see the hard muscles of
the man strain as he caught it in both hands before it
hit the ground. Some of the peons were chanting now,
and some were slapping the boards of the warehouse with
a native rhythm. But the black still watched for Rio’s
approval and this time, when Rio clapped, the peon
squatted down again, rolling his big eyes and making a
clucking sound.</p>

<p>Amused, yet abiding by an adolescent impulse to exhibit,
Rio walked to the bunch of bananas which the
black had returned to the pile and took firm hold of the
large stem with one hand. He threw himself forward,
then backward and down, till the tip of the bunch was
pointing upward and the stem was braced against his
neck. Slowly he came up, the veins pulsing in his forehead
and sweat trickling into his eyes. For a second he
stood at full height. Then the white heat, the black men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and the misty, green bananas began to turn. He staggered;
but pulling himself together, lowered the bananas to the
pile again. The peons laughed loudly and the big black
jumped up and down. Easing closer, he examined Rio’s
arm. At last, he called out to the others.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Dos músculos en un brazo!</i>” he shouted triumphantly.</p>

<p>A young oiler from the <i>Swamp Rat</i> nudged Rio.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He said I have two muscles in one arm.” Rio turned
to the black and shook his head. “<i lang="es">Fué un engaño</i>—it was
a trick!”</p>

<p>The peon grinned and his fellow-workers yelled, “<i lang="es">Engaño!
Engaño!</i>—Trick! Trick!”</p>

<p>They were still noisy when Rio started for town. Off
the edge of the wharf he heard children laughing happily.
He noticed that a group of five was huddled around
a bunch of bananas which had fallen from a truck. One
of the children, a boy, dressed in a clean cotton shirt and
ankle-length trousers, had his back to him and was flicking
a little whip at the fruit. As Rio walked that way
there was a shrill, warning whistle and the boy with the
whip turned as though he had been pinched. When he
saw Rio however, he straightened up and for a moment
surveyed him carefully. Then he modestly lowered his
eyes.</p>

<p>“A penny, sir mate?” begged the child.</p>

<p>Rio stared at the boy and struggled to think clearly.
The face was that of Martin—the same chin, the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
forehead. He had the same way of standing. Yes, he was
a dark replica of Martin, much younger and with a more
beautiful face—but still the face of his friend. One thing
further startled Rio. On each cheekbone of the child was
a clearly defined disk of rouge, the size of a dollar.</p>

<p>Rio felt a little angry and spoke roughly.</p>

<p>“What have you done to earn a penny?” he asked.</p>

<p>The boy seemed quietly mischievous and a flush appeared
above the rouge. Rio thought he posed against the
sunlight.</p>

<p>“If I trap my enemy, sir tarantula, sir,” he said, “then
will I earn a penny?”</p>

<p>The rest of the children laughed.</p>

<p>“How will you catch him?” asked Rio, bending over
the bananas for a possible sight of the creature.</p>

<p>The boy cracked his whip and pointed to the edge of
the wharf. At his command several children ran and
brought back an old piece of tarpaulin. This they held
silently over the bananas, making sure that no light could
filter in. Then the boy drew a line in the sand and spoke
softly in a jargon unfamiliar to Rio. Whereupon with a
shout the others threw back the canvas and a large, hairy
spider which had crawled out into the darkness was revealed.
The boy flicked his little whip—and the tarantula
was divided. For a second, the halves quivered. The
beauty of the boy’s eyes sharpened and the other children
shrieked with glee. When the quivering ceased the lad
stooped, and picking up one broken part of the spider,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
fastened it to the end of his whip. Rio dropped a penny,
studying the little fellow, who looked down admiringly
at his kill and at the coin.</p>

<p>Rio was suddenly thirsty and headed down a road by
the sea for the town. It was a hot patch to cross that day
and he stopped often to look at the harbor which somehow
gave him the illusion of coolness. Once, as he stood,
he noticed the boy with the little whip silently following.
Rio put his hands on his hips and waited for him.</p>

<p>The child was excited, but restrained. He had been
running and was breathing rapidly. His shirt was open
and the damp cotton fabric was plastered to his slender
body. Ringlets of dark copper hung to the small beads
of perspiration on his forehead or curled away from his
brow. His intense brown eyes looked directly at Rio and
he stood most straight as though expectant and afraid.
Rio was struck by the attitude and by the sudden unnatural
impression of maturity. He had never seen a lad
so full of fever—and knew this picture was as colorful
as any wild and distant fragment of his own. The boy
stepped nearer and pointed toward the town.</p>

<p>“May I walk through you, sir mate?” he asked.</p>

<p>Rio nodded his head and when the boy came alongside
he dropped his hand on his shoulder. The lad was
shaking. Rio took his hand away and the boy quieted.
Rio started sweating. This wasn’t sense. He walked on
more rapidly, the boy keeping pace with him.</p>

<p>“The Cafe El Americano stays open long, sir mate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Will you not see my sister first? She comes from the
sea.” The child took long strides, matching those of Rio.
He was nearly breathless. “Always ... out of the sea
... come our sisters and daughters.... Even to your
big hefty.”</p>

<p>The sidewalks were narrow and Rio sat down on the
curb and rocked and laughed and rocked till the charming
old ladies crossed both themselves and the street for
the rum this sailor must have taken. In solemn condemnation,
they shook their fingers behind black fans with each
other—but hastened away where they could laugh delightedly
in their loneliness. At last, Rio stood up and
wiped his eyes. He gave the boy ten cents in silver, looked
at the drying tarantula still fastened to the little whip,
and entered the Cafe El Americano. The lad’s face was
wistful. He shook the spider violently, flinging up one
delicate, brown hand.</p>

<p>Instead of standing at the bar, a group of seamen had
grabbed some chairs and were sitting around while the
proprietor brought drinks. Rio pulled up a chair and
asked for a rum punch. The seamen were from the other
ship and he did not know any of them. They were teasing
a young sailor who was apparently making his first
trip. The boy looked sullen. One good-natured seaman
with the face of a German butcher whom the others called
“Dutch,” was particularly amused. He turned to Rio,
who was near him, and said, “The kid did like all of us,
first time out—struck bells for stars, thinkin’ they was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
ships’ lights. The pay-off came after the mate gave him
the devil and told him not to miss a god-damned ship,
but to skip the stars; for we met the whole Pacific Fleet
doin’ maneuvers, and the kid hit so many bells the Old
Man came down and asked where in hell the fire was.”</p>

<p>The sailors roared and Rio smiled; but the harassed
young seaman said, “Aw, shut up. God! You’ve told that
fifteen times.” His face was as red as the German’s.</p>

<p>Dutch was still laughing.</p>

<p>“Wait till I tell it the thirtieth, lad—wait till I tell it
to your mutter.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you tell it to my ‘mutter’!—God!” The kid
threw himself at Dutch, both arms flailing. The sailors
laughed and scrambled for him, holding him from Dutch
who had his head in his lap and was howling louder than
ever. Finally the kid was exhausted and the sailors set
him up in his chair. Dutch got up, went over to him and
gave him a pat on the back.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the last one I picked up,” he said. “I was
in Iran when I got this yarn out of a peddler who had
brought it down from Baghdad. He sold it to me for
coffee.”</p>

<p>The kid grinned and the sailors settled down.</p>

<p>“This peddler,” continued Dutch, “said there was a
couple up there soon to be married when the Sultan
spotted the woman. He takes her into his harem and bein’
a cruel son-of-a-bitch, orders his Chief Barber to castrate
the man. Then he plans to bring the poor bastard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
into the Royal Household as Chief Eunuch so he can
watch the guy suffer every time he sees his old girl. The
fellow asks one favor—that his father, who is also a
barber, be the one to do the trick.</p>

<p>“The Sultan says yes, but that he’ll take a look afterwards
to see there’s no funny business. Well, the father’s
a sport and gives his son a stroke with his blade ’midships,
and fastens him up with a few stitches. The man
takes it like a good egg, only he fans himself a bit and
takes a bottle of spirits in one swig. He lays around for
several days, and finally gets up, a little pale, but whole
in body except for his watch pocket. Then he goes to the
Palace and the Sultan takes a few sights at the evacuated
area and is satisfied.</p>

<p>“Now the Sultan has led a hell of a life, and the girl
tips off her sweetheart that in spite of turtle eggs, snake
wine, pampas beetles and blended herbs from Crete, the
old boy can’t get it up. So the Chief Eunuch tells her he
has a little surprise for her; and they go down to the lily
pond to observe the constellations. Then he returns to his
post and she to her couch to sleep sweetly. A few months
later the Sultan gets suspicious.</p>

<p>“The Favorite says, ‘You did it in your dreams, Celestial
Master.’</p>

<p>“‘O.K., my little sugared rose leaf,’ says the Sultan.</p>

<p>“And when the brat is born the Sultan slices off the
heads of twenty prisoners to celebrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t no time before the Favorite sidles up
to him again.</p>

<p>“‘You had another dream, Celestial Master.’</p>

<p>“But this time he’s wise. He hides behind the reeds
of the lily pond one night, and sees the Eunuch and his
old girl come down the trail. In a few minutes the Sultan’s
eyes pop out of his head. He hears the rustle of the
grass and the next thing he knows, a tight mainstay and
a tall foremast is reflected in the water of the pond beside
the lily pads.</p>

<p>“Of course, both heads was thrown into the Tigris.
But the Sultan, thinkin’ maybe the first time was a dream,
handed over ten concubines and the Great Emerald of
Phallis to his son.”</p>

<p>Dutch stopped talking. The seamen’s faces were blank.</p>

<p>“I don’t get it,” said one of the sailors. “How could
Balled Billy swing it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I paid coffee to find out,” said Dutch,
solemnly. “There was a god-damned testicle under his
vest. It didn’t come down when he was born. It was
hangin’ high—but it worked.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p>“God!” said the kid.</p>

<p>Rio went to the bar, had a small rum straight and left
the Cafe El Americano.</p>

<p>The boy who looked like Martin sat, half sleeping,
on the sidewalk where there was shade. He still clutched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
his little whip and Rio noticed that the dried portion of
the spider was still fastened to it. When the child saw
Rio he jumped up.</p>

<p>“At last, sir mate, are you ready to go to the house of
my sister?”</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon and as hot as a volcano. Rio
wanted to find the coolest place he could and take a nap;
but he looked at the youngster and said yes.</p>

<p>The boy piloted him through a small market. The
siesta hour was over and the stalls were being reopened.
The air was heavy with the odor of pawpaw and fish;
heavier still with the heat. The cloying scent of khus-khus
arose from one section of the market as an ageless
woman, more Indian than Spanish, smiled between her
shoulders and bobbed in front of Rio, one arm around
a bundle of the grass. Rio, enjoying its fragrance, handed
her a coin. In the stalls much of the fruit was so thickly
covered with flies it was impossible to tell its original
colors. The vendors, mostly Spanish, seemed indifferent
to sales and followed Rio apathetically. Once, he stopped
to admire a woven mat, then walked on laughing at the
obscene pattern.</p>

<p>Alongside him the child waved his whip at the flies.
At the next corner he stole a piece of dried fish. They
passed the square gray box which was the solitary bank,
the stucco houses with their virulent colors well moderated
by the prodigality of vines, went on to the outskirts
of town and into the Street of Curtains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>There was no sidewalk. They walked unhurriedly
along the dusty road. Everywhere, the heat fell like individual
hammers. It lay in a transparent film between
the rows of houses and gathered in blue puddles across
their path. It was too early for the girls to work and
everything was quiet except for a wind from the harbor
which disturbed the curtains that formed the entire front
wall of each house. Once a small brown arm reached out
languidly, and once they heard a giggle and a soft
whistle.</p>

<p>“I like this Street, sir mate,” said the boy. “Everyone
gets happy here by ten o’clock every night. Believe me,
sir, they get fine and drunk here. Last night a girl smoked
weeds and ran nakedly down the Street. She screamed
beautifully and nakedly. And a seaman from the <i>Swamp
Rat</i> wouldn’t pay El Gaucho.” The boy laughed.</p>

<p>“Who’s El Gaucho?” asked Rio.</p>

<p>“She is the biggest woman on the Street, and has four
Snakes working for her. When the seaman didn’t pay
for one of her girls, we all knew what. Yes, he was fine
and bloody when she finished whipping him with her
garbage can. Some of the girls, sir mate, call her ‘Mister.’
And that might be truth, for I saw her give money
for just a feel to a woman. But sir, we are home.” He
took Rio by the hand, pushed aside the curtains and they
went into the house.</p>

<p>A girl was sitting in the corner, reading a book by
the dim light of a lamp. The boy ran to the table upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
which the lamp was burning and turned up the flame, although
it was blazing outside beyond the tightly drawn
curtains.</p>

<p>The girl closed her book and looked at Rio steadily
for a moment; and Rio felt that he had entered a different
country. There was a wild perfume, sharp as a chemical.
In the angle of light and cut of the draperies the
girl’s skin became darker. Rio tried desperately to find
her eyes which were vague under the heavy lashes. She
was not so beautiful as her little brother; but some mystical
quality outlined her charm more severely.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said.</p>

<p>The boy went to her and caught her about the waist,
holding on until the girl bent over and kissed him on the
forehead.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Rio, feeling awkward, and yet wanting
savagely to hold them both in his arms. That might be
his salvation. He desired them both with such a horrible
necessity that for a second he was paralyzed. They moved
apart and Rio felt that one moment of fruition had been
blasted into Hell. He took off his cap.</p>

<p>“My sister isn’t from here,” said the boy to him jubilantly.
“I love her, and I like it here. But I wouldn’t
want her from here.” He turned to the girl. “I’m going
to make a cool green drink for sir mate, and bring him
a cool towel, sister. For he’s had that bad rum at the
Americano.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>The girl’s expression did not change when the boy had
gone; but she motioned Rio into a chair.</p>

<p>“Where did you find him?” she asked. “Where did
you find my little brother? Marius is a strange child.
He drifts around, but he seems safe from everybody—”
her voice rose passionately, “—everybody.”</p>

<p>Rio replied absently, fascinated by the girl’s frail
dignity, so contrary to her enterprise.</p>

<p>“I found him playin’ in the sand by the banana docks,”
he said. “He kind of reminded me of my best friend.
Somehow, he made me think of Martin.”</p>

<p>The girl spoke frankly.</p>

<p>“It only happens so. Our father loved our mother and
lived here many years with her. One day he was caught
in a storm. He was fishing—” She hesitated. “And after
that, our mother could not remember things. It was well
she died.... He was an educated man—a gentleman
who came this way.... That is why the boy speaks
as he does. He remembers the lessons of our father.”</p>

<p>Marius returned to the room with a chilled lime drink
for Rio, and rubbed Rio’s face with a moist towel.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the ice?” asked his sister, smiling.
“Did you steal it?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the child. “I bought two pennies’
worth from the ugly red man in the ugly red cart.” He
picked up a box of rouge and went to a wide mirror.
Then he carefully repainted his cheeks. The deep color,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
though applied in indiscriminate and garish quantities,
served still further the willful abandonment of his
features.</p>

<p>“You use too much,” said his sister. “Why do you use
so much?”</p>

<p>“Because it makes me look like an old girl. Just like
an old girl I know,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“That isn’t true, Marius,” answered his sister scornfully.
“You think it makes you pretty. You’re too pretty
already. The Snakes have told you it was pretty, and
you let them play with you. I won’t let them play with
you.” The girl’s cheeks were flushed.</p>

<p>“A damned poor women are the Snakes,” said the
boy. “Before that happened, I’d talk sassily. Besides, I
don’t like women.” He threw the rouge back on the
dresser and left.</p>

<p>Rio walked over to the girl.</p>

<p>“This is a queer place, sis, and he’s a queer boy, and
you’re a queer girl. I don’t get it. I feel almost like one
of the family, and yet—” he put his arms under the
girl’s shoulders and lifted her to her feet, “—and yet,
I feel funny. Like I been doped. I’m crazy about you
and the kid and the story you told me. Aw, hell! Why
talk about it.” Almost angrily he took a twenty dollar
bill from his pocket and laid it on the dresser.</p>

<p>The girl didn’t smile. She looked curiously at the
money for a moment and then covered it with a book.</p>

<p>Rio held her tightly and then stepped away, his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
closed. When he opened them she was quietly undressing.
He tried to help her. But his fingers were clumsy.</p>

<p>The girl threw back the curtain around the bed and
lay down, her eyes staring upward as though searching
for something. Rio looked up too, and saw a tapestry
hung like a canopy over them.</p>

<p>“The Madonna!” he cried. “Good God! Not here!—where
She can see!”</p>

<p>The girl lifted herself. On her face lay the shadow
of pain. She spread her thick hair on the pillow with
swift fingers, except for one dark strand which cut across
her breast like a wound.</p>

<p>“Why do you mind Her?” she asked. “She is kind....
She is forgiving.... She is there, where one can
pray to Her—afterwards.”</p>

<p>There was no hesitation in the girl’s voice—no quality
of naïveté or assumed virginity. There was a cold knowledge
of fatality and an inflexible acceptance. There was
even the protective shroud of fanaticism; and Rio saw
her, gentle, but receptively immune.</p>

<p>He thought of Martin. Martin would turn the picture
of the Madonna upside down and go ahead.... Yes,
he thought, Martin would take her and her sisters—and
even old Agnes in the unplowed field. But he wasn’t
Martin, thank God!... And for a second or two he
repeated to himself, “Thank God! Thank God!”</p>

<p>“No,” he said. He knelt down and held the girl as
though she were a child. He whispered something to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
her and she smiled at him. After a bit, he stood up and
searched through all his pockets for coins. He found that
it amounted to about ten dollars. He laid this with the
other money.</p>

<p>The girl had put on her light dress and they stood for
a second by the curtain. They stood looking at each other.
Then Rio went out into the early twilight.</p>

<p>That evening the girl did not light the tiny kerosene
lamp outside her curtained doorway.</p>

<p class="tb">As Rio started up the Street of Curtains Marius ran
to him. The boy was chewing vigorously on a sandwich
and in the hand in which he held the whip was a package.
He gave it to Rio who found a similar sandwich within
the package.</p>

<p>“Try it, sir mate,” he said. “It’s good, if you’re on the
gamey-flavor side of things.”</p>

<p>Rio bit into the sandwich, found it tough and certainly
on the gamey side, but made palatable with some lettuce
and pepper sauce. It was refreshing to him; and he was
glad to see the boy again; gladder still to leave, for
awhile, the world of frangipani—a world which called
and yet rebelled inevitably against him.</p>

<p>By this time lights were beginning to be seen along
the Street, and a few brown girls began to call to Rio.
One unusually persistent one followed them for several
paces.</p>

<p>Marius stopped, turned round and said in Spanish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
“Bah! How many times would you have a man break
his back!”</p>

<p>The woman replied in a high voice.</p>

<p>“Shut up, little pimp!”</p>

<p>To which the boy shouted, “How will your favorite
cat look when I eat him to-morrow night?”</p>

<p>The woman screamed and ran back to her stall.</p>

<p>Rio looked at his sandwich suspiciously, then dropped
it guardedly where the child could not see.</p>

<p>They went back to the ship the same way they had
come. On the edge of the town by the road to the sea,
the boy tugged at Rio. Nearby, an hibiscus bush was in
full bloom. Marius pointed to it. The red disks on his
cheeks glowed in the twilight. Fastening his trousers
about his slim, bare ankles, he leaped into the air and
caught one blossom. Then he gave Rio a shy, sweet glance
and gravely hung the flower behind his ear....</p>

<p class="tb">Rio was carrying the little whip when they walked
onto the docks. He looked down at the child beside him.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said to the boy, “do you think I could catch
sir tarantula, sir?”</p>

<p>He didn’t know whether Marius was crying, for his
own eyes were wet. But he did know that a child of untranslatable
beauty, with a mouth like a bow and a heart
which he knew was indisputedly his, was standing quite
still before him. He lifted the boy—kissed him on the
mouth, and headed for his ship, half stumbling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XV</i></h2>

</div>

<p>When Deane opened the door Rio was standing
there. He bent his head a little as the light from the room
beyond fell upon him. He looked at the back of his wrist
where an ugly scab, ripped by a loose strand of cable,
seemed an offensive sight in front of this woman. He
tried to cover up the wound with his cap. It was such a
painful moment as he stared at his great crude hands
that Deane moved instinctively toward him. She saw the
hurt, shamed child in him, but more than that, within
the tense breach she saw the man. Rio’s arms, which now
hung by his side as though he were disgraced, fascinated
her, then became repellent by her very daintiness.
Yet she ventured still further. What a wide cloth across
his wrist! And why the heavy jaw and painted muscles
of his neck—dark by one edge and golden by his collar!...
What a tie!—so hideous, that clarified the purpose
in his eyes! For now he was looking down at her.</p>

<p>“Close,” he said in a low voice. “Very close,” he repeated,
remembering the urge, the fomenting inspiration
when he had left her before. In his eyes Deane had the
appearance of a small, dark seal. It was more than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
shimmering under her dress—more than a watery sea
movement of her hips that led him on until he touched
her. As he held her by the arm her black velvet gown
fell sharply away from her throat, and he looked for the
first time at her breasts. The maturity, the obvious, sleek
movement contained within her resembled his own feeling
now. He lowered his head. Deane closed the door
and clasped her hands behind his neck. His lips were
burning her unbearably. She tried weakly to brush them
off.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it,” she almost cried. “I can’t.”</p>

<p>Rio took his face away from her throat and laid his
hands upon her thighs. Without effort he lifted her high
above him. He was calm. There was no note of hysteria
in his voice, only a slight tension of his muscles. Then he
said, “Spit!” turning his face sideways so that he could
feel it better. “Two dogs,” he repeated intensely. “Spit!”</p>

<p>Held like a doll above him—understanding his meaning,
accepting the fact of her treachery, Deane turned as
wild as the awakened animal beneath her. She knew that
she was floating, knew that she was full of hatred for
Martin and not Rio. She opened her little red mouth and
spat against Rio’s cheek—once, twice, three times!—until
she was breathless. And Rio, grim, lost again from
his friend, lowered her and shook her by the hair until
they came together squarely and the dull sound of illicit
kisses moaned through the empty corridor.</p>

<p>When Rio released her they stood apart, looking at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
each other with only Deane’s breath and the metallic
drops upon his cheek as a memory. Then Rio sighed and
wiped his face with the cuff of his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Whatever kind of God there is,” he said, “I’m
damned! <em>Now</em> I’ve showed Martin the kind I am!” he
continued as if to himself. “He’s crazy—he’ll know....
And as for you,” Rio turned to the woman once more
and whispered fiercely, “you’re a black witch.”</p>

<p>Deane was leaning against the wall, still breathing
heavily. She made no attempt to answer and Rio continued.</p>

<p>“We better go in now and face him,” he said. “It’s the
first time in my life I been ashamed like this.”</p>

<p>“I’ve kissed a fool,” replied Deane in a soft voice,
“and I don’t want to stand here any longer with him!”
She bit her lips. “Mr. Roberts will be glad to see you.
Come on in.” She opened the door.</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said Rio, following her.</p>

<p>Martin heard his voice and stood up.</p>

<p>“Hello, Rio,” he called. “That was a short trip.”</p>

<p>Without speaking, Rio went to him. Then he looked
around, frowning, saw Roberts, saw the young man he
had met in the hall and another, a stranger. Martin
watched him with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“What the devil?” he asked.</p>

<p>Deane interrupted.</p>

<p>“I believe you know Mr. Roberts, Rio,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>Rio turned in the adviser’s direction, shrugged his
shoulders and nodded.</p>

<p>“I know him, Mrs. Idara.”</p>

<p>Roberts was sitting at the far end of the room. The
north light from the window was so severe that it formed
a blue overshadow on his dark hair and outlined his
proud face in a series of sharp angles, unnoticed by any
but Deane. He arose and bowed stiffly, his lips set.</p>

<p>Carol had been watching the newcomer intently all the
while and now at this cue from Roberts, he skirted two
chairs and smilingly eager, held out his hand to Rio
who looked amused.</p>

<p>“My name is Stevens,” he said. “Carol Stevens.” Rio
pulled his hand away but Carol continued. “I know why
you boys look like sailors.” He glanced at Martin, then
back at Rio. “You both do, you know. You get so nice
and tan. My goodness!—but you travel so! It’s simply
romantic, isn’t it, Deane?” he added, still staring at
Rio.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Deane answered, preoccupied, her hand to her
hair. “It is romantic, Carol.” She turned to Drew who
was standing patiently by his chair, a rather vacant expression
on his face.</p>

<p>Rio looked at the immaculate, slender fellow sourly
when he was introduced. Drew, however, gestured in mild
acknowledgment, maintaining his appearance of abstraction.
Then deliberately he stepped forward and reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
for a short, thick cigarette on the small end-table where
Rio, partly leaning, had placed his hand. The cigarette
glowed unnaturally as Drew touched a match to it, and
he looked straight into the eyes of the sailor which were
now even with his own. Then, as the two men stood there
face to face, Drew’s lips parted slightly and the smoke
curled in a heavy roll from his mouth. When the dense
vapor disappeared, he smiled unevenly, and with eyes
lowered, returned to his chair where he leaned upon it
gracefully, one slim hand upon its back.</p>

<p>Martin watched the fantastic play in a stolid, philosophic
mood, coldly regarding Rio’s frightened look.</p>

<p>Deane became uneasy.... “What was Drew’s secret
action that had accomplished such an unthinkable expression
upon Rio’s face. Was it,” she reminded herself, “the
smoke?—or Drew’s protective anger based on his uncanny
knowledge of her own affair beyond the door?—or
was his melancholy fury a safekeeping just for
Martin!”</p>

<p>Roberts had begun to cough violently. With each
paroxysm he held a handkerchief closely to his lips.
Deane went to him but he waved at her with petulance.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” he answered in reply to her question
of concern. “It’s this strangulation! Damn such an affair!”
he said irritably and sat down. “I don’t understand
it, and I don’t want to,” he added, and immediately
went off into another seizure of coughing. The others
stood around him anxiously, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, please sit down,” said Deane, throwing herself
on the divan and waving her pretty arms in little, indecisive
movements.</p>

<p>Rio and Carol obeyed her, but Martin hurried into the
kitchen and Drew, still pensive, continued to lean upon
the back of his chair, watching Roberts as though but
vaguely aware of his predicament. Martin returned with
a glass of water and putting his arm around the adviser’s
shoulders, held the glass to his lips, trying to get him to
swallow between spasms. Gradually the spell quieted and
Roberts looked up at his friend. Then he took the glass
from the other’s hand and gulped the rest of the water.</p>

<p>“I’d like another,” he said, wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>Martin nodded, took the glass and returned to the
kitchen. When he came back Roberts accepted the drink
more slowly.</p>

<p>“Will you please hold your arm the way it supported
me before?” he asked, looking again at Martin, this time
with a rather contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>Martin put his hands in his pockets and stared out of
the window, his eyes the color of the gray, low-sweeping
clouds.</p>

<p>The adviser watched him for a moment, then put down
the tumbler of water almost untouched. With a half suspicious
expression he now looked around at the others.</p>

<p>“No,” he said distinctly, “I’m not afflicted. And Drew,
this isn’t hysteria, so stop thinking of that.”</p>

<p>“I know,” agreed Drew, nodding his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“Let me make some tea,” suggested Deane, as spiritedly
as she could.</p>

<p>For a moment the adviser was gentle.</p>

<p>“No, Deane,” he said. “You shouldn’t bother. You
see,” he smiled somewhat wanly, “everything is stimulated
enough.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Drew. “It’s getting too late anyway.”</p>

<p>Across from them, Carol’s head seemed to pivot
around the side of his chair like the brass plate of a
revolving door.</p>

<p>“Of course, dear,” he repeated. “It’s getting too late.”
Then with a slithering movement, his head spun slowly
round again and he could be heard faintly whispering,
“It will soon be cocktail time ... cocktail time.”</p>

<p>Roberts shuddered.</p>

<p>“That should settle it,” said Martin. He lit a cigarette
and looked at Rio. “But it won’t. Do you have anything
to add about tea, sailor?”</p>

<p>“No, by heaven!” exclaimed Rio. “What I have to say
ain’t about tea. Of all the people and talk I ever seen—”
He had started to rise when Deane stopped him.</p>

<p>“Tell us about your trip, Rio,” she said. “Where did
you go?”</p>

<p>He hesitated, but finally sat down on the edge of his
chair, looking sullen.</p>

<p>“A little banana town. In South America,” he answered
at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“Santa de Marina?” asked Martin, looking interested.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Rio.</p>

<p>Martin turned to the others and spoke proudly.</p>

<p>“Rio took his own ship into that harbor once.”</p>

<p>“So Rio was a master!” observed Roberts. Then, staring
at the floor, he said with a cruel abstractness, “Yes,
the sea is relentless. Many derelicts seek my aid on land
when they find deep water too deep.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” declared Martin instantly. “And many
landlubbers are drowned because <em>they</em> can’t step a mudpuddle.
But they are not even derelicts. They’re just old
bags. Of course,” he said, turning round, “you’re a
derelict, Rio. But Mr. Roberts wasn’t thinking of you.
I’m sure of that.”</p>

<p>Rio was watching Roberts with such dreadful intensity
that when Martin finished, the adviser’s head snapped
back like that of a toy.</p>

<p>Carol shifted about in his chair and stretched his legs.
He felt the confused streams in the room, and it made
him restless.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Rio, still watching Roberts intently.
“He didn’t mean me. Once he made a mistake and
I saved him from a derelict. Maybe the fellow let him go
just so he could try it again some time. That thing you
said about the mudpuddle is right, too, Martin. I’d think
Mr. Roberts would be afraid. But he ain’t, Martin.”</p>

<p>Roberts did not hear all of this. He remembered those
bitter eyes and hands too clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>Carol broke in.</p>

<p>“I wish I could talk like <em>you</em> talk,” he said, addressing
Martin. “I think you have the most—well, the most
<em>exciting</em> things to say.” His face was pink and moist.</p>

<p>Rio grinned wickedly.</p>

<p>“He’s an exciting man, Carol. That’s why he says exciting
things,” he declared, emphasizing his words with
a sly nod of approval.</p>

<p>Roberts looked distastefully about him. “My God!
This!—all over again!” he thought.</p>

<p>But Carol continued, beaming, “I knew a boy in Chicago
that was almost the same way as you, Martin.
Every one of us boys said it must have been a trick. He
could just turn everything into the best time. And my!—he
was handsome! I think he was a bouncer at some cafe.
And strong—Oooooh!” Carol adjusted his yellow tie and
his eyelids fluttered.</p>

<p>Martin felt increasing annoyance at Rio’s persistent
grin.</p>

<p>Still Carol went on blindly. “I’d like to work the way
you do, Martin, and get oil and things on me from those
machines. And that linotype you operate!” he continued.
“I’d just <em>love</em> that!” He put his hands flat on his trousers.
“Imagine,” he said, turning to Deane at last, “having one
of those big things to play with!”</p>

<p>Rio laughed openly, and Roberts turned away in disgust;
but Martin said, “That’s right, Carol. We’ll have a
talk one day, all by ourselves.” He went over to Rio. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to say anything. But
he cursed him with his eyes, and with a vagrant motion
of his lips.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Rio asked him.</p>

<p>Martin replied coldly, “You’re a fundamentalist. I
can tell it from the expression on your face.” Then he
went to the door. Before he closed it behind him he
looked back. “It’s taken me nearly thirty years to get
this picture,” he said, and he was gone.</p>

<p>Rio stared at the door where Martin had left.</p>

<p>“There goes a clever lad,” he said. “He knows us
well.” He turned to Roberts and glared at him. “He
knows you well, indeed. I’d hate to be you. I can see the
black days. And,” he added, laughing, “he knows me, all
right—but, he don’t know himself. He’ll whip himself to
death.” At the word “whip,” Rio had hesitated. Although
the room was cool, he started sweating. Without even
saying good-by to Deane, he put on his cap, quickly went
outside and slammed the door so hard that the floor shook.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven,” said Roberts quietly. “Humanity is
maintained—the anthropoids have gone—civilization
stands. Let them yell into space and beat their knuckles
on drums made of their own skins. But pray God, they
yell in the forest and not here. Thank heaven for Society!—even
if it is covered by a fool’s cap,” he continued,
watching Carol. Turning his eyes to the ceiling
and then to Deane, he added incoherently, “We have
been shown our destiny. Our portraits, painted by savages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
hang on Olympus.... I hope, Deane, that you
are not disturbed by the painting, or,” he said, bowing,
“by your destiny.” He breathed deeply, painfully. His
shoulders were bowed, his face whiter. “You must excuse
me,” he said. He walked to the door, opened it, walked
out and closed it gently.</p>

<p>Drew also went to Deane and spoke so that Carol could
not hear.</p>

<p>“A strange afternoon, little sister,” he said, bending
over her affectionately. Then he turned around. “I’m
holding a drag to-morrow night, Carol. I’d like to have
you come.”</p>

<p>Carol’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Oh, Drew, I’d love it! To think!—I can come in
drag!”</p>

<p>Drew restrained an impulse to pet the boy who was
regarding him delightedly, as in some glorious enchantment.</p>

<p>“There is a sort of radiance about him,” he thought,
half smiling at himself for thinking it. But as he left,
Drew took Deane’s hand once more. “Don’t see Roberts
until I talk with you,” he whispered. Deane nodded her
head and Drew went into the hall.</p>

<p>Carol twisted his cigarette holder, put in a cigarette
and lit it grandly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he sweet?” he said. “Martin’s sweeter, though....
But the others!” he added with disdain. “Of course,
you have your own life, Deane, so I won’t ask you why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
you tolerate such people about.” He sighed gratefully.
“But isn’t it nice, dear, to be alone? I never could stand
vulgarness. I’m really quite surprised at Mr. Roberts to
let himself be upset by—” Carol thought hard, but
couldn’t quite understand what he was talking about. He
smiled gently though, and continued, “—to be upset by—well—just
everything.” He leaned back against his chair
and put his feet up on another. That was well said. He
could tell from the way Deane looked that it had affected
her.</p>

<p>Deane regarded the smiling, piggish face.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, Carol,” she said, thoughtfully, “I don’t
understand, either.”</p>

<p>The night became darker and the lamps inside softened
Carol’s features. Deane tried to rest. It was good to be
away from men for awhile. Even Drew was difficult at
times. She unfastened one of her stockings. Carol smoked
and smiled and nodded his head at the wall. This was as
it should be.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to Deane, came the sickening realization
that both Carol and herself were thinking of the same
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XVI</i></h2>

</div>

<p>After the maids had cleaned the apartment and had
left, Drew went to the dressing room, removed his white
shirt and collar, handed them to a small Chinese boy
and seated himself before the vanity, observing the strain
on his features which had come so suddenly.</p>

<p>“Your father was a wise man, little Tai,” he said to
the child. “Place your hand on my shoulder. Do you find
it hot?”</p>

<p>The child bowed and went to Drew, acting as he had
been bidden. He avoided Drew’s eyes in the mirror and
his voice trembled.</p>

<p>“Yes, Master,” he said, but he could not keep back his
tears; so cupping his tiny hand, the little, hot gems were
caught before they fell upon Drew’s head, which now
rested upon the edge of the vanity.</p>

<p>“We will go away very soon, Tai,” Drew said at last.</p>

<p>The Chinese boy did not answer, still fearful of betraying
his emotion; but for an instant he hovered over Drew
with the same patient love of his own distant gods.</p>

<p>“Master,” he whispered finally, “I have some secret
petals from my father. He told—he told me—” Little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Tai burst into open tears and kneeling, placed his head
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Drew turned around in surprise and seeing the lad
prostrated before him, bent his own shoulders lower, the
Orient in his eyes. Then, scorning in his tenderness all
laws of blood and caste, he picked up the boy and laid
him upon the ottoman. Still weeping, Tai lay in a tiny
curl, his golden tunic tight against his back. Drew quickly
knelt down and whispered to him.</p>

<p>“Were the petals for my bath, little one?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sobbed the child.</p>

<p>“Tai,” said Drew gently, his soft fingers brushing the
tears away, “they were given to you for a time when I
should be very sick. Is that not so?”</p>

<p>“It is so, Master,” whispered the child. He sat up with
a cat-like movement. “I have a little golden whip, Master.
Will you strike me?”</p>

<p>Drew looked at him strangely. Rio had mentioned that
word in a curious fashion only the day before. Could it
be that by coincidence?—Drew stopped the course of his
reflections and arose. The symbol of the whip was ridiculous!</p>

<p>“Bring me the scourge!” he said.</p>

<p>Tai ran to a wall-cabinet, and from the vase which held
his father’s ashes he pulled, coil by coil, a gilded whip
and handed it to Drew who took it by its handle looking
with intensity at the cruel barbs at the end, and wondering
if they were poisonous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“I shall not beat you, Tai,” he said finally. He looked
now at the handle and thong which held his wrist. “Tai,”
he said, “are the petals a secret, really?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master,” said the boy, smiling shyly.</p>

<p>Drew held out his delicate fingers.</p>

<p>Blushing, and timidly approaching, Tai bowed over his
master’s hand; and in his moment of adoration murmured
a little prayer his mother had taught him. Then
taking a small, scented package from the breast of his
tunic, he ran toward the bathroom, turning once in the
doorway to bow his devotion.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Drew replaced the whip and laid
his arms across his face. And as he heard the sound of
small feet on the tile and the water running for his bath,
he looked again into the vanity and cried out in a high,
soft voice an unintelligible name....</p>

<p class="tb">Tai twisted a white satin robe about Drew’s slender
form as Floyd, the hairdresser, was announced.</p>

<p>“Is everything in readiness for Madame’s coiffure?”
asked the expert, mincing forward.</p>

<p>“Yes, Florabelle,” said Drew, standing once more before
the vanity.</p>

<p>Tai withdrew with backward steps.</p>

<p>“Florabelle” took a small silk handkerchief from his
pocket and gently dusted the bench upon which he suggested
that “Madame” rest her slender form. With much
bowing and curtsying, Floyd was now ready to proceed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
with his masterful art of transforming this man into a
charming hostess.</p>

<p>The beautician was slight, with tiny features. Although
he was well on in years, he looked no more than
fifty. “A half century plant,” he had once called himself.
He wore his hair long and dyed it periodically, according
to the fashion. On his feet were patent leather pumps of
shining black, with medium heels. With his frock coat of
gray he wore dark trousers. While engaged in his profession,
he affected a long white smock with a lavender lace
handkerchief in the pocket over his heart. His cheeks,
having been recently paraffined, were now symmetrical
and would remain that way for weeks to come, when their
contour would again have to be remodeled.</p>

<p>He fingered Drew’s hair, combing it straight back from
the head. The short locks fell gracefully between his
fingers as they discussed the different styles—dismissing
this, then that one until the matter was decided. Then
quickly Floyd began his craft.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, “as a privileged acquaintance of
long standing, do I know any of your guests of this
evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Florabelle,” said Drew, in a soft and gracious
tone. “You recall Beulah. She has been suffering lately
with acute indigestion and general complications. But
she’s coming.”</p>

<p>“My <em>dear</em> Madame!” The artist raised his eyes to the
ceiling. “<em>That</em> one! <em>She</em> should have retired from society<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
years ago! She is very well fixed financially, you know,
but oh!—she is so tight! I’ll wager she’s home now dressing
her own hair! Imagine! The ends will all be burned,
and there’ll probably be some burns on her neck. It
simply makes me shiver! And she’ll wait until she gets
here to-night to use <em>your</em> powder! It’s not that I care—but
I could transform her into a beautiful person. Her taste
is vile—simply vile! And dearie, with <em>that</em> face!—I’d
have to work for hours and hours! As I’ve said before, I
don’t care what she does, but she <em>could</em> be made
ravishing!”</p>

<p>Florabelle’s dainty white fingers had been busy at
work—shampooing and rinsing—and were now in the act
of combing the hair and turning the soft ends under.</p>

<p>“What gown has Madame selected to enhance her
singular beauty, if I may ask?” questioned the little
hairdresser.</p>

<p>“White velvet, ’Belle. I feel nostalgic this evening,”
answered Drew.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Florabelle in delight. “Then indeed I
have a gorgeous surprise for you! I have an amazing
lotion, greaseless, odorless, which tints the hair an incredibly
lovely white. I used it on Monsieur—” he bent
down and whispered a name into Drew’s ear. “She insisted
upon it. Madame was <em>very gay</em> that evening. It was
the first time I had tried the preparation on any of my
exclusive clientele. Madame was wearing a short velvet
jacquette of green over her white velvet gown; and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
wore green rouge on her cheeks and lips in the current
Parisian fashion. Dearie,” the hairdresser put one finger
to his lips and took a step backward, “would you like to
be the first to use these tints in America?”</p>

<p>“I should love white hair with the dress,” said Drew
thoughtfully. “But not the green. I prefer to wear a small
jacquette of black velvet lined with red. Make my lips the
same shade as the lining.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Florabelle. “You shall be a dream!” And
he set to work.</p>

<p>Drew sat quietly, continually admiring himself in the
mirror—an occasional turn of the lip or a raised eyebrow
showing approval—amazed with each glance at the
artistry of the man who was transforming him.</p>

<p>Florabelle talked incessantly, constantly gesturing
until Madame’s coiffure was finished.</p>

<p>“Ah, Drewena!” now cried the little hairdresser. “You
are complete—so perfect!” he exclaimed delightedly,
finishing off with a touch of perfume upon the eyebrows
and behind the lobes of Drew’s ears.</p>

<p class="tb">Drewena walked slowly through the drawing room and
critically observed the fold of the draperies. It was just
before twilight and through a high, oval window crested
with stained glass, she idly watched the towers below her.
There were tears in her eyes. The light became softer,
barely touching now the throats of the doves which nested
in the eaveless pinnacles, subduing the irregular flash<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
against their wings. Their silent, ever-changing motion
somehow caused her to think of Martin; and the recollection
of the mannerisms of her friend—that isolate,
strange night in the cocktail lounge—his actions there,
sometimes gentle, but more times cruel, made Drewena
close her eyes. Why these tears?—like those of a younger
passion—full of the same anxiety, the same dull anger at
enslavement and desire to escape! She looked into the
east, formed her lips into a smile and turned away. Tying
her white satin robe more closely about her waist,
Drewena sat down at the piano, one slim, white leg
against the casing of deep ivory. On each end of the piano
was a tall cathedral taper, lighted. The irradiance was
vague under her hands as she improvised. The melody
was reminiscent of Chopin, and again of Debussy.
Drewena consciously built a theme upon their lovely
chords, and smiled to herself as she thought of the semblance
of originality attained by other contemporary
plagiarists. As she continued to improvise, Patsy, known
as “Pat” on more sober days, entered the drawing room.</p>

<p>An “English” butler, whose father had been Irish,
Patsy was carrying a small bouquet of black lilies
brought from the Malay peninsula at great trouble by
Drew’s florist. Devoid of her usual attire, Patsy was somewhat
ridiculous. Her concave nose and forehead where
the toupee failed to hide the round, bald skull, gave her
a strange type of “swish.” Her upper teeth sagged in the
back when she talked, and her bulbous lips had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
appearance of an aging tomato. She wore a little “how-de-do!”
of white lace upon her wig which had become
entwined in it. A single wart of considerable size pushed
through the tiny cap which fell at intervals over her nose
for lack of better support. Her black silk skirt was short,
showing the bony protuberance of her knee where once,
in a moment of folly, she had mounted a horse and was
promptly unseated, bruised and flattened. Her blouse was
full, barely concealing two lemons she had taken from
the icebox. Altogether, with her wide grin and unhappy
form she was seemingly the most pathetic of creatures.
But when Drewena languidly motioned for silence while
she played on, there was an amused understanding between
the servant and mistress as Patsy adjusted the
flowers on one corner of a table where they would catch
the reflection of their darkness in a tall mirror whose
frame was a wreath of golden doves in flight.</p>

<p class="tb">In Deane’s living room, Martin stood by the divan
examining a long-trained evening gown of canary yellow.
Its pale satin sheen in the lamplight was unusually
luminous against the blur of the couch. Martin spoke
earnestly.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand, Deane. A guest can’t be just
an observer at one of these private affairs. I’d be clumsy.
I wouldn’t fit in and I don’t see why you want me to go.”</p>

<p>There was a perverse light in Deane’s eyes. She was
thinking strangely. She wondered: <i>Is he sure, really sure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
he won’t fit in?</i> But aloud she said, “Drew invited you
and that is sufficient reason.”</p>

<p>Martin looked at the dress again.</p>

<p>“Am I supposed to wear that fantastic rig just to
satisfy a whim of yours and Drew’s? I tell you, Deane,
the entire situation is repellant to me.”</p>

<p>Again Deane thought in the same odd manner: <i>It isn’t
like him to shy away from anything. He knows himself
so well—is it that he’s afraid?</i>—she stopped these
thoughts. “It only seems repellant, Martin,” she observed.
“Drew will make things easy.” She bit her lip. “And
Carol and Roberts will be there, too. Why don’t you take
it as a joke?” She tried to laugh, but the effect was so
hollow and unusual that Martin turned and put his arms
around her.</p>

<p>“What is really behind this, Deane?” he asked her
gently. “Is Drew attempting a new type of drama, and
are you in on it? If it’s a game, I’ll go along with you.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a game,” said Deane insistently. “There isn’t
anything dark or mysterious about it. It’s just a costume
party—a stag affair, that’s all.” She avoided his searching
gaze.</p>

<p>Martin laughed brutally, the hurt and sickness inside
him manifested. Then he sobered, looked at her steadily
for a moment, a faint shine in his eyes.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said quietly. “What do I do first?...”</p>

<p>After he had taken a bath, he shaved as closely as
possible and rubbed his glowing body with a scent not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
unpleasant, although he imagined that he detected the
impossible effluvium of man-oil as its base. Next he
pulled on long stockings of a light sun-tan, his lip curling.
But the curious feel of silken underwear and all the intricacies
of the garter belt intrigued him, and he laughed
aloud as he fastened his stockings to it. The artificial
breasts were made of soft rubber fiber, of medium size
and cup-shaped in appearance. It was with considerable
trouble that he hooked these objects on, the elastic and
stays acting contrary. The dress went over his head with
difficulty, also; but he twisted and pulled it until it came
into place. After he had smoothed out the wrinkles with his
hands and set it square with a few quick jerks he felt more
comfortable—the gown was even cool and good against
his belly. So he sat down with relief and put on the pale
yellow satin slippers set aside for him. When he stood
up, however, one ankle bent under the strain of the high
heel. After that he moved more cautiously, trying to remember
the principles of navigation on an icy, rolling
deck, and although he lacked a certain naturalness, he
soon walked easily enough.</p>

<p>Deane laughed and clapped her hands when she saw
him and seemed herself again; but in a moment she returned
to the grim abstruseness of her former attitude.
She narrowed her eyes, put on an apron, then draped a
towel around his neck to keep from spilling the make-up
on his shoulders. Martin leaned back, closing his eyes in
silent despair; while Deane, testing each shade of lipstick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
on her hand until she found the right one, realized
that she had never tried so hard with herself. She gave
his lips, which seemed carved, a brilliant color for the
artificial light.</p>

<p>“Damn it,” he said.</p>

<p>Deane did not reply. It was unlikely that she heard
him, for the same antagonistic attitude surrounded her;
and, too, she was absorbed by her painstaking job. The
blue line of underbeard around the jaw and chin had to
be blocked out; for this, she used a flesh-colored paste,
rubbing it in gently. The rice powder was rachel in
shade, made almost the color of Martin’s skin by the
addition of a pinch of ocher. This was carefully
smoothed away. She used no rouge. And so she continued,
blending and examining, until she stepped aside
to view her finished handiwork and exclaimed rather
sharply, “Sit up!”</p>

<p>Which Martin did, looking at her with a kind of agitated
wonder. But Deane, seeing only his face—with his
gray eyes now turned to green, and his somewhat melancholy
expression softened by women’s devices, ran to
him, fell on her knees and began to weep deeply. At this,
Martin lifted her to him, holding her, trying to kiss her
cheeks. But she slipped away and dried her tears and
blew her nose, saying, “It would spoil your looks and
I’ve worked too hard for that.”</p>

<p>He started to put his hand to his head but Deane cried
out, “Oh, no!” For his hair, parted in the middle, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
been combed back of the ears to a point at the base of his
neck, where a braid, similar in shade and texture, had
been cleverly attached, wrapped and pinned. His hair
was now the same wheat-like color as his skin; and the
cold, precise line from his head to his shoulders had the
essence of that deliberate, calculated passion which so
often appeals to the sensitized, yet physical individual.
When at last he stood up and lit a cigarette, leaning with
a conscious gracefulness upon the piano, Deane went to
him and looked up at him uncertainly. Seeing him stand
there in such elegance and strength, she bitterly regretted
the perversity which had driven her to push him toward
this mad adventure. And though her pride rebelled at
calling it off at this late moment, she said rather timidly,
“Of course, Martin, you don’t have to go if you really
dislike it so much.”</p>

<p>“What?” he almost shouted, looking at her incredulously.
“Well, I’ll be damned!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” said Deane nervously. “Of course you’re
going! I was just teasing.” But she looked at this man in
woman’s clothing and she realized she had never been so
attracted. She watched the long muscles flex in his arm as
he moved his cigarette. A furious desire struck her.</p>

<p>“You must hurry,” she whispered, gritting her teeth.
“You will be late.” Again Martin looked at her steadily,
the green glaze covering his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll return immediately after the party,” he said, picking
up the wrap she had chosen for him. “Read this—”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
and he pressed a letter into her hands and left, unsmiling.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Deane opened the letter with
feverish haste and read it swiftly. Still standing, she
threw it across the room, removed her hairpins and
mussed her hair until it was wild. With a sob she flung
herself face down on the divan and worked her body on
the pillows until she screamed. Then she wept until she
fell asleep.</p>

<p class="tb">Carol arrived at the drag wearing a leopard cape with
a high, stiff collar. There was a single stone in his triple-peaked
tiara, filigree work coiling around the gem. Patsy
helped him off with his wrap, glanced slyly at his rather
buxom figure, and announced him in the drawing room
in a falsetto voice.</p>

<p>“Miss Stevens,” cried Patsy, in her unusual pitch.</p>

<p>Drewena hurried forward and put her arms around
her guest.</p>

<p>“Carrie!” she exclaimed. “You look simply gorgeous!”</p>

<p>Carrie’s cheeks deepened with pleasure. Her saucer-like
eyes gave out a wet, blue happiness.</p>

<p>“I’m <em>so</em> glad you like me,” she said. “I didn’t want to
look tacky.”</p>

<p>“‘Tacky,’ indeed!” said Drewena, for the beauty of
Carrie’s gown astonished her. “<em>That</em>,” she continued,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
looking at the dress, “<em>is</em> a creation! Where did you find
it?”</p>

<p>Carrie’s eyes shone with pride, though at the same
time there was delicacy in the way she modeled the skirt
with her hands.</p>

<p>“I didn’t find it, Drewena. I designed it. I made it for
next spring, thinking perhaps I <em>might</em> be a June bride.
I planned to do it in white if the style was attractive.”
Carrie looked a little anxious. “Is the severe line too
much for my hips?—they are rather large.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, dear,” answered Drewena. “It is very
becoming.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Carrie, “you <em>do</em> prefer the material to
taffeta or crepe. I’m <em>so</em> glad,” she continued. “Those
flouncy things always make me feel like a middle-aged
matron.” She pushed the blonde hair of her transformation
more firmly behind her ears and touched the roll at
the back of her neck.</p>

<p>Drewena marveled at the change in her young friend.
How awkward and lonely Carol had appeared in the
stilted, formalized trousers styled for men! And how
charming was this lovely Carrie, away from the stiff
tailoring of masculine attire!</p>

<p>Drewena studied the gown. As she saw it, the waist-line—the
Grecian fashion in which the garment fell into
the imperceptible folds of the long train, had the artless
symmetry of certain sculpture. The dress was without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
sleeves, close-fitting, with high, pointed breasts, and with
its back cut low, to the waist. Its color was a gentle pink
of shaded salmon that blended into Carrie’s smooth bare
arms. There were two golden bracelets on her wrists and
two small bells on the ring-finger of her left hand. Following
the soft curve of her throat was an exquisite,
golden necklace. As she stood and turned in such a manner
that her white back, with a tiny mole on the shoulder
could be seen, Drewena put her arm around her waist,
and pulled her aside, where they could talk alone.</p>

<p>Out in the hall, Carrie grasped the arm of her hostess.</p>

<p>“Will Martin be here to-night?” she asked almost
shyly.</p>

<p>Drewena frowned.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my dear,” she said at last, noting the
child-like look of disappointment which appeared on
Carrie’s face.</p>

<p>Inside the dressing room, which had been transformed
into a powder room for the guests, a pompous creature
was seated at the vanity. “Beulah” was a retired manufacturer
with a great deal of money in the bank, but no
penchant for spending it. In fact, she was known to drive
the sharpest bargain for “trade” of any of her sisters,
never carrying more than a quarter in her pocket when
she cruised. Nor did her pick-up have to be presentable,
for she worked the doughnut shift. “They’re all the
same,” she used to say sententiously. “Just throw a sack
over it, and shoo it out before dawn.... And never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
give them breakfast,” she would caution, if permitted.
“It spoils them.” Whenever the fleet was in, she would go
into retirement. She would lock all her doors and keep
her butler on a kind of sentry duty, not even admitting a
hallboy who might have an idle moment. As far as the fleet
was concerned, no one quite understood Beulah’s strange
reaction. But it was established fact that once, avoiding
her usual care, she had sneaked away to the drugstore
for a soda. Intent upon her guzzling, she had failed to
notice a sailor who had sat down close beside her. But
upon turning her head and seeing the man in uniform,
Beulah had let out a shriek, her eyeballs had rolled
upward and she had fainted dead away. Some said that
doubtless it had been some frightful experience which
had given her this strange allergy. “It must <em>simply</em> have
put her in stitches!” one of her friends had observed....
As for the hallboys, it was true, she never paid
them well; but there were always things to be picked up,
and Beulah’s eyes were failing. The hallboys loved her
for this little infirmity, and never took anything more
than they felt was honestly due. Altogether, Beulah was
regarded as a rather queer, but decidedly powerful person
in her set; and no young debutante could expect a
successful coming out unless Beulah was behind her—which
she usually was.</p>

<p>Thus Drewena realized the value of this social contact
for Carrie if the young girl was to spend much time
in New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“You look awfully nice this evening, Beulah,” she
said. “What are you doing out here all alone?”</p>

<p>“Powdering my face like <em>mad</em>,” Beulah answered,
daintily packing the rich powder into the sore jaw and
chin where she had shaved too closely. “Those faggots
outside are dishing me to death. Just wait till I go in,
though. They’ll stop their cackling!”</p>

<p>Drewena led Carrie to her by the hand.</p>

<p>“Beulah,” she said, “I want you to take Carrie under
your wing to-night. She may not be in New York long
and I want her to have a grand evening. I’ll want her
part of the time, when I’m not going the rounds.”</p>

<p>Beulah lifted her sagging, experienced face to Carrie,
who stood there, fluttering slightly. Then the dowager
graciously held out both her hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you the <em>best</em> people, dearie,” she said. “Just
hold on to your old auntie’s arm and we’ll see if there
isn’t some trade in sheep’s clothing. And by the way,”
she added, smiling shrewdly in the sunless room, “is that
little bitch, Kate, going to be here? I’ve made a vow to
do that one! She can’t fool these old professional eyes—tired
though they may be.”</p>

<p>Drewena laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, Beulah, she’s here. And quite beautiful too, in
green. She just got back from Chili—some kind of an
electrical engineering project.”</p>

<p>“‘Project,’ my grandmother!—rest her bones.” Beulah
sniffed. “Doing the Indians again—what she sees in
<em>them</em> is beyond me! But the hussy <em>is</em> interesting.” Beulah<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
swished the bow at her back, spread the wide skirts of
her lavender gown and opened a long black ostrich
feather fan. Breathing deeply, so that her large bust
swelled out, she followed Drewena out of the room,
taking Carrie on her arm.</p>

<p>“There she is,” she whispered hoarsely, and the old
lady stopped to glance covetously at Kate.</p>

<p>Kate was dressed in a green velvet gown of a deep
jade cast. Her necklace was of intercircled loops of jade
as was her linked green bracelet. The earrings were
slender pendants of the same hue and stone. With this
ensemble she was bound to use a cautious make-up—her
skin, tanned by the flat sun of the Andes, being
almost enough. Only a dark red splash across her lips,
as though she had been recklessly eating cherries, seemed
a necessary cosmetic. Her black hair was curled bewitchingly,
up from the forehead and sides. When she saw
Beulah, she beckoned wildly and the green purse which
hung from her arm banged against a punchbowl which
was near the tiny bar.</p>

<p>“Common!” someone said in a stage whisper, but Kate
only laughed and crooked her finger at Beulah again,
who strode forward with aggressive, formidable steps,
half dragging Carrie.</p>

<p>“Have a drink, darlin’?” asked Kate, looking up at
the dowager.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear,” said Beulah, in an affected
voice. “It’s <em>so</em> sweet of you to ask me.”</p>

<p>Kate ladled out two drinks. As she handed one to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Carrie, she said, “That’s a lovely gown, honey. Drewena
told me you made it yourself. Why don’t you drop around
at my place some time next week and show me how you
do it?”</p>

<p>Beulah coughed slightly and pinched Carrie’s arm.</p>

<p>Kate turned to her with another glassful of punch.</p>

<p>“Here you are, dear,” she said. “It will be good for
you.” But she was thinking, “I’ll bet it’s the first free
drink she’s had in months!” Aloud, Kate spoke again.
“And now, darlin’, <em>do</em> have another.”</p>

<p>Beulah nodded graciously, her eyes a little brighter.</p>

<p>Kate thought once more, “You old bitch! I hope you
choke on it and get as blue as blue can be!”</p>

<p>“Kate, dearie,” said Beulah, after her fourth, “there’s
just the right touch of bitters to the bottle—it makes one
have a feeling of heavenly bliss!”</p>

<p>Kate smiled and thought, “You don’t know a good
drink from a bad one. You just take all you can get, and
that’s all you know. You might have been pretty in your
day—but your blooming days are past forever.”</p>

<p>At this moment, a splendid creature bore down upon
them, all sails set. She was a broad-shouldered fellow,
whose snappy skirts and impudent coiffure failed to cover
her intention.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” she exclaimed. “Just dishing it!”</p>

<p>Kate took a whisky straight and smiled at the “debbie”
in a tantalizing fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“To think,” said Kate, “a moment ago there wasn’t a
piece of trade in sight! I was just hoping.”</p>

<p>The big girl turned around and looked back over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried in an obligato, “you New Yorkers
<em>can</em> be so bitchy!” Then she sailed on and rounded the
turn to the powder-room.</p>

<p>“Dirt!” said Beulah.</p>

<p>“Tawdry!” exclaimed Carrie.</p>

<p>“From Boston?” asked Beulah.</p>

<p>“No, Baltimore,” answered Kate. “Working up from
the bottom in her father’s steel mill, I believe. That’s
where she got the muscles. The thick head came naturally
though.” Kate opened her purse and took out a
small bottle of perfume from which she removed the
stopper. Shaking a few drops of the scent on her fingers,
she touched them to her ears and throat, patting the
remaining moisture on the imperceptible beard around
her chin.</p>

<p>Just then, Patsy’s familiar voice announced “Miss
Roberts.”</p>

<p>Drewena was standing by the door as the newcomer,
somber of face even through her high, natural coloring,
and as Drewena thought, all the more beautiful because
of her stone-like gravity, entered the drawing room; for,
dressed in a cunningly fashioned gown of silver cloth,
she looked more like an impassioned Joan of Arc in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
mailed armor than a modern executive of lives. Around
her throat lay her mother’s string of black pearls, and
her hands were encased in an unusual muff of blue fox.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you came after all, Roberta,” said the
hostess quietly. “You have been keeping too much to
yourself, and I’m sure that you’ll have a little fun to-night.
Carrie is here—she’s the most amusing camp!
And Kate, and Beulah, and Docky——”</p>

<p>“Damn them all!” interrupted Roberta. “Take me to
that corner over there where no one is standing.”</p>

<p>Drewena saw the painful expression on her face and
nodded agreement, sitting down with her for a moment.</p>

<p>“Is Martin coming to-night?” asked Roberta nervously.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Drewena. “That is, I think so. I sent
him a note, urging him to be here. I have such a pretty
name for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” answered Roberta, a little absently,
tapping her silver slipper against the side of her
chair. “Is Rio coming?”</p>

<p>“Indeed not,” said Drewena, amazed at the question.
“Ask that man up?—I should say not!”</p>

<p>“‘Man’—my petticoat!” observed Roberta. “What’s
the matter with you, Drewena? <em>That</em> one is dashed for
fair! Her hard-boiled act doesn’t fool me a bit. She’s a
damned <i lang="fr">poseur</i> and as full of bitchery as——”</p>

<p>“Stop shaking,” broke in Drewena. “For heaven’s
sake! All the cats are beginning to gossip about the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
you’re acting. See old Docky talking with her hand over
her mouth? She knows perfectly well that I can read lips.
If she hadn’t been a splendid surgeon in her day and
attended my father years ago, I should never have
invited her.”</p>

<p>And Docky was saying to the more elderly group
clustered around her at this moment, “It’s shameful the
way Roberta monopolizes Drewena’s time. In a way
though, one can’t blame her. For dearies, Roberta hasn’t
long to be a queen at the rate <em>she’s</em> going!” Docky pulled
her shawl more tightly about her neck.</p>

<p>“What <em>is</em> wrong with her, Docky?” asked one rather
vapid, sweet-faced auntie. “Is she sick?”</p>

<p>At this, Docky raised her lorgnette and looked at the
speaker, a quiver of amusement lacing her cheeks back
and forth until it seemed they would have met if her
nose hadn’t kept them apart.</p>

<p>“Precious!” She lifted her hand. Enormous jewels
sparkled and flickered on every finger. “<em>I</em> wouldn’t know.
I haven’t been out with her since she was a child—ah!”
Docky breathed. “Those halcyon days!”</p>

<p>Back in the corner Drewena sighed.</p>

<p>“If you won’t, you won’t, Roberta; but it looks like
intrigue, and I hate intrigue. You’re positive you won’t
give even a short number? I wish you’d read one of your
own lovely poems. You did, last year, and they’ll expect
it. Of course, if you won’t, I’ll send Carrie over to keep
you company during the program.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“Not unless you want a murder at your drag,” said
Roberta in such a menacing voice that Drewena started,
then watched her guest for a moment until the fire was
out of Roberta’s eyes, and some of the hatred expressed
on her face had dissipated.</p>

<p>“Roberta,” she said at last, “if you are ill, you should
go home. It would be doing both of us a kindness.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sick,” said Roberta evenly.</p>

<p>“Why do you hate Carrie so much?” persisted
Drewena.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like that,” said Roberta, in despair. “It’s
just that she <em>thinks</em> of Martin. She thinks of him in a
terrible way. Please don’t question me further.” Roberta
opened her compact, studied herself in the tiny mirror
and powdered her face lightly, smoothing away the lines
from her forehead and looking with detachment at the
shadows under her eyes. Drewena took her hand for an
instant and held it tightly before she left. But as she
walked toward the punchbowl with its merry company,
there was an intimate, definite foreboding and a striking
glance of prescience from her heavy-lidded eyes. Her
appearance was so exotic, so provocative, that when Kate
offered her a drink, she wanted to offer her a kiss as well.</p>

<p>The widows around Docky, however, were still discussing
Roberta.</p>

<p>“Look at her,” said Daisy, the pretty one. “Holding
her jaws down at the side in that manner. If I were half
so pretty as she, I wouldn’t hide in the corner like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll <em>bet</em> you wouldn’t,” yawned Docky, grasping her
upper plate, as she had a horror of swallowing it.</p>

<p>Again Patsy’s high voice rang out, this time against the
music of the orchestra.</p>

<p>“Miss Devaud,” she bawled.</p>

<p>Drewena’s face grew whiter as she went gracefully but
swiftly to the arch-like entrance to greet the new arrival,
whose perfect casting—the unusual make-up against the
wheat-colored hair, against the long, pale yellow dress,
against the turquoise of her eyes, and the strong, uneven
modeling of her features brought the hostess to a stop
before she reached her guest.</p>

<p>“Beautiful Miriam,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Miriam contemplated Drewena without expression,
though enjoying her beauty far more than she liked to
admit. While Drewena was thinking in confusion how
and where to get her friend alone—away from the others
who would spoil her with their eyes—yes, with their
thoughts, as Roberta had said. If she, Drewena, could
only touch her once—could only hold her.... So taking
her guest by the hand, she quickly pulled her back
into the hall.</p>

<p>“Come upstairs for a moment, Miriam,” she whispered
hoarsely. “You must have earrings to make you
perfect. I have some of jet that will make you lovelier
than ever!” They ascended the wide spiral staircase.</p>

<p>Carrie ran after them. On the bottom step she paused.
As they disappeared around a bend in the stairs, Carrie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
clung tightly to the newel post. Then turning, her eyes
wide, she stepped down and hurried to Beulah.</p>

<p>Roberta, sitting in her corner, saw all this, and the
rapidity with which she changed coloring caused old
Docky to chuckle something about adrenalin. But Roberta
was really acting strangely. She seemed ready to leave
her chair, then at intervals would pull something halfway
out of her muff. Docky could not quite see, for
Roberta covered the object cleverly. Each movement,
however, was hesitant, until finally, with a certain air of
fatalism, Roberta settled down in a rigid posture which
she maintained for some time.</p>

<p>Upstairs, Drewena opened a door beyond the staircase,
and led Miriam out on the terrace. Saturn was in
conjunction with the frozen moon. Midway between the
zenith and the horizon, the moon, as if by some prearrangement
lightened Drewena’s white face until her
beauty would have been nebulous had she not been
pressed so closely to her friend. Miriam’s face, however,
had caught the amber tone of the planet, and her cheeks
seemed flushed as though by moonburn. Drewena pulled
her inside again and sat beside her on the bed. She
turned out the indirect lights and lay down, her head on
Miriam’s lap. The moon shone upon them brightly.</p>

<p>“Miriam,” she said, “is that a halo around your
head, dearest?”</p>

<p>“It’s the moon in the fuzz of my wig,” answered
Miriam seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>Drewena sighed. “How I wish,” she said, “that we
could have stayed out on the terrace!—Perhaps we can
come up here after the guests have gone.... This bed
is so deep and wide, we’ll cool off quickly.... And to-morrow
we can go to a little cottage I have up on the
coast near Cape Cod.... We’ll listen to the wind—and
there’ll be snow, and the surf breaking on the rocks
under our doorstep.... You’ll carry a lamp to help
me to my bed. I want to be dependent on you—oh! you
understand!” Drewena put her gentle hands on Miriam’s
cheeks. “They’re hot, Miriam. Perhaps you are excited,
too—perhaps I won’t have to go away as I told Tai! He’s
my little protegé! I’ll send him to France with his tutor....
My dearest, tell me that I needn’t go!”</p>

<p>Miriam petted her gently and explained quite simply
that of course she didn’t have to leave; but when that was
said, she kept repeating, “Go!—go!—go!—” continuing
to blend the words until they became untranslatable.</p>

<p>Drewena looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked. “Those words—they
have a cadence that makes me feel insane—Please
don’t talk like that!... Dear God!—All I ask is that
you bear with me. I’d never cheat Deane. It’s on a different
plane. Quite different. Kiss my lips, Miriam—I’m
tired—so tired.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Miriam gently, “that I <em>can</em> do! For you’re
as sweet a little maiden as I’ve ever seen, lying so in the
moonlight.” And bending over, she pressed her lips<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
upon Drewena’s. The white-tinted hair fell over her
shoulders and Drewena shuddered as Deane had shuddered.
There was no distaste, for Drewena lay quietly
now in Miriam’s arms, only a slight, convulsive movement
betraying her passion. Then Miriam sat up and
leaned away as though into the moon; for a feeling had
come over her during that kiss that she could not interpret.
It was a half sick, half desirous mood of great intensity.
And so, unaccustomed to tempering her emotions,
she threw Drewena back upon the bed and held her
tightly, her mouth pressing on her throat. Drewena did
not resist until the desire had grown and Miriam groped
blindly. Then quickly Drewena struggled away and as
quickly turned on the lamps.</p>

<p>“Not now,” she laughed, a splendid light in her eyes.
“Later—after the party. Oh,” she exclaimed, bending
toward her friend, “it’s the heaven I thought I’d never
find—the soul, the mind, the body.... But now, we
must hurry and touch ourselves up.” And she hung the
long, jet pendants from Miriam’s ears. So the gowns
were smoothed out, the hair recombed and pinned, the
make-up applied anew.</p>

<p>When at last they entered the drawing room there was
only the faintest buzzing of interest among the more
intrepid of the gossipers. Even this ceased as Drewena,
her arm linked closely in Miriam’s, stopped at various
groups to introduce her friend. Docky stopped chattering
just long enough to size up Miriam’s figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“Miriam, my dear,” she said at once, “if I’d known
<em>you</em> were coming, I’d have worn my new gown of cardinal
red. To think!—you see me in the faded splendor
of this musty blue! You must come and chat with us this
evening.” She looked at Miriam intently and pulled her
shawl even tighter. Then she smiled, a good deal of
understanding and more than that, compassion, expressed
in her face. When Drewena took Miriam with her to the
punchbowl, Beulah turned on Docky in a fury.</p>

<p>“Only past sixty, and you’re back to childhood! I
could scratch your eyes out! Miriam is simply lovely,
and now you’ve driven her away!”</p>

<p>“There, there,” Docky said, in her best professional
tone. “It’s just as well—Drewena loves him.”</p>

<p>“‘Him’?” screeched Daisy, fascinated.</p>

<p>“Don’t get so excited, Daisy. Remember your blood
pressure,” said Docky calmly. “Of course, ‘him’! The
boy’s as jam as the preserves you used to steal off your
mother’s shelf!”</p>

<p>“Absurd!” said Beulah. “She has a <em>grand</em> dash!”</p>

<p>“On the edge, dearie, but he’s never fallen off, and I
doubt if he ever will. The habit pattern has unfortunately
fixated him for women. Ah!—if I could have had
him to mold some years ago!”</p>

<p>“<em>‘Jam’!</em>” cried Daisy once more, her hands to her
ears.</p>

<p>Docky pushed back the wisps of gray hair from her
forehead and took out her left eye, wiping it carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“Mercy!” said Beulah. “<em>Must</em> you do that in company?”
She tossed her head angrily. “And don’t tell us
how you lost your real one at Ypres! There!” She
pointed swiftly toward the punchbowl. “I <em>knew</em> it! Kate
is trying to snitch Miriam from Drewena!”</p>

<p>“Common!” said the same sepulchral voice that had
uttered this word before.</p>

<p>Everyone turned around to see who had repeated it,
but there was no one in sight. Docky chuckled.</p>

<p>Kate was speaking vivaciously to Miriam until she
caught Drewena’s eye, whereupon she merely shrugged
her strong bare shoulders and turned petulantly away.
The moment of ensuing silence was broken by Patsy’s
high-pitched tremulo, which seemed to be growing
weaker.</p>

<p>“Miss Murphy!” she shouted feebly.</p>

<p>Miss Murphy did not wait for Drewena’s welcome.
She flew into the room in a state of deshabille, her black
lace dress torn slightly on the shoulder, her corsage of
gardenias darkening around the edges as though they had
been crushed in a heavy fist.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” she said, breathing heavily as Drewena
comforted her.</p>

<p>Kate stole a glance at Miriam and whispered, “Doing
the taxis again!” Then she took a glass to the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Drink this, Sophie,” she began, when the other turned
on her, stamping her foot and pulling the torn lace back
over her shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you <em>dare</em> offer me any of that sickening, frothy
slop!” she cried. “I want a straight one, or I’ll just <em>die</em>!”</p>

<p>Kate lifted the glass and drained it.</p>

<p>“‘It was good enough for mother, and it’s good enough
for me,’” she quoted sweetly. But Drewena called for a
glassful of whisky and handed it to Sophie who began to
drink it greedily.</p>

<p>Docky had her hand over her mouth again and was
leaning toward Beulah.</p>

<p>“Don’t look now,” she said. “Sophie’s watching us
like <em>mad</em>. I’ll bet she thinks we’re dishing her.”</p>

<p>“Well, dearie,” said Beulah, her hand covering her
lips also, “she’s right. But I won’t smile, and don’t you
<em>dare</em> look now.”</p>

<p>But Docky went on, the rest of the group straining
toward her, for no one could dish like Docky.</p>

<p>“My God, Beulah,” she said, “they speak of <em>courage</em>
in history. But she has a <em>nerve</em> to come here in <em>that</em> lace!”</p>

<p>“‘Lace’!” Beulah appeared shocked. “She bought
that netting at the ten cent store to cover her trade with,
when she gets that Cleopatrine feeling! No <em>wonder</em> all
the cab drivers around Pennsylvania Station are looking
tired these days!”</p>

<p>“Shish!” said Docky. “Look now, dearie. She’s terrible
from the front. Do you notice her fallen chest?...
And what do you think of the back? And oh!—what
ugly hands! I’m sure those hands have snitched many
pieces of silver in <em>her</em> time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care how much silver she has snitched,” said
Beulah, “but I <em>do</em> hope she’ll keep her dirty mitts off
Miriam. Really, Docky, you don’t honestly believe that
Miriam might be jam, now do you?”</p>

<p>Docky leaned over and spoke into Beulah’s ear.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell anyone, but I’m really sure. I really
shouldn’t have told you, but since you have thrown so
much my way in the past——”</p>

<p>“Christ!” said Daisy, fidgeting with her lavaliere.
“Sophie really makes me ill. She always looks as though
she’s straight from the washtub.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Docky, “from the shanty on the other
side of the tracks. It’s a shame for her to have money,
with me dodging creditors like <em>mad</em>! Look at her trying
to be elegant, wiping her nose with her soft, raggy wrist—and
dearie, her nose isn’t running from a cold. <em>That</em>
one’s been broken down for years and years. Old saddley
ass! She looks as though she had three pillows in her
rear!”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> indecent,” agreed Beulah. “And she doesn’t
have fallen arches for nothing. She’s been cruising <em>most</em>
of her life.”</p>

<p>“That she has!” said Docky. “My God!” Docky leaned
forward excitedly. “She’s picking up her skirts! Do you
see those varicose veins on her leg? They stand out like
the knots on a pinetree!”</p>

<p>Drewena was now urging Sophie to give the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
“number” of the evening. But Sophie, partly drunk from
her brief, but thrilling escapade with the cab driver, kept
showing a bruise on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“It hit me! The person really hit me! It was all over
that cage I brought for my number. Will you have Patsy
bring me the cage I left with her? I’ll be in the powder
room.”</p>

<p>When she had gone, Drewena explained to Miriam
that each guest always gave a little act.</p>

<p>Miriam was thunderstruck.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything to do. It’s impossible for me.”</p>

<p>“Just anything,” said Drewena, with composure. “It
doesn’t have to be much.”</p>

<p>Miriam thought a moment, observing the heavy beam
above her, the high ceiling and the shadows.</p>

<p>“Was that Tai whom I saw peeping out into the hall a
moment ago? The child looked Indo-Chinese. If you’d
lend him to me....”</p>

<p>“I can’t risk the child,” said Drewena slowly. “His
father nursed me. And next to you, Miriam, I love him
better than anyone but Deane.” Drewena gave a queer
smile. “<em>She</em> has a portion of the roundtable of my mind
that no one, not even you, my dearest, can fathom.”</p>

<p>“I won’t hurt the child,” said Miriam earnestly. “He’ll
think it’s a lot of fun. You can see what I’ll do!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” said Drewena, flushing. Then, “All
right. Tai is yours for the trick. What else do you need?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“A man with powerful shoulders, and a rope,” said
Miriam. “And have the orchestra play loudly while I
work.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Drewena laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are really good!—I see it now. You’ve always
just pretended to be an impossible person. I believe
you’d cry easily.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I cry very easily,” Miriam agreed.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Roberta?” asked Drewena suddenly.
“She was asking about you.”</p>

<p>“You mean Roberts? No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s in a corner, pouting about something. It’s
either you, or Carrie—perhaps even myself. She is in a
terrible mood to-night. Please don’t have a scene with
her. And please, Miriam, remember, this <em>is</em> a drag. I don’t
care how masculine they may seem to you,—call them
by their feminine names, or address them impersonally
as ‘she.’ Do you see Beulah over there in her lavender
gown?... He was thirty-nine and three times married
before he recognized himself for what he was. Being a
flexible character, he slipped quite naturally into his
present rôle—that of a tight-fisted, gossipy old dowager,
but behind the intermittent lechery of his old and experienced
eyes he is a strong man and a gentleman. No one
in the everyday world even suspects. They’ve marked
him down, in fact, as a devil with the ladies. Kate is a
harsher type. He married one of the most beautiful
women I have ever seen. She bore him a lovely boy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
Then one day, Kate became irritated over a trifle and
threw his wife across the room. Fortunately, she was not
injured; but he went into a ‘break’ or nervous explosion.
From that, into a depressive state and out of it in a wild
hysteria. Then came his first love—his consulting psychiatrist....
The pattern was woven swiftly enough—and
Kate, too, slipped into her niche, not so pleasant a
one as Beulah’s, who takes them as she finds them. Kate
is now searching desperately. You will not?—” Drewena
hesitated. “Forgive me, Miriam. And now, let us visit
Roberta. Please give her a smile and I know she will feel
better. We must hurry. Sophie will soon be ready for her
act, and you must prepare your magic.”</p>

<p>They walked across the floor, both sated—one by boredom,
the other by necessity. When they approached
Roberta, she stood up, one hand touching the pearls at
her throat, the other holding her muff.</p>

<p>“Drewena,” she said quietly, with slow sarcasm, “it
would be a pleasure to meet your friend. She is very
pretty in yellow. Did Carrie make the dress?” Roberta’s
lip curled. Once more her hand moved convulsively in
her muff.</p>

<p>Without a word Miriam stepped up close and running
her fingers down Roberta’s arm, slipped her own hand
well inside the tiny fur. Roberta shook her off; but
Miriam, now looking at her friend as though intrigued,
said slowly, “Perhaps you’d like another cocktail,
Roberta. It will warm you. Your hands are like ice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>Drewena looked on, but finding the scene too difficult
to interpret, shook her head sadly, murmured something
about the program and led Miriam away.</p>

<p>Roberta, still brooding, was left alone in her corner.</p>

<p>Standing by the piano, Drewena clapped her hands
and the crowd grew quiet.</p>

<p>“First,” she said, “since Sophie is not ready, I’ll ask
Daisy, who has come in her perennial form of the
‘Prairie Flower’ to sing for us.”</p>

<p>Docky sniffed and whispered to Beulah, “Look at her!
She doesn’t even have to make up for the part! My dear,
do I <em>have</em> to listen to that miserable dentist do her wild
flower act again? It’s just been repeated and repeated
till I could simply scream! Imagine, trying to carry on
at <em>her</em> age when we <em>all</em> know she’s well into the menopause!”</p>

<p>Daisy, however, tripped across the floor, her black
taffeta dress flouncing around her wide hips. After bowing
to the somewhat bored and suffering crowd, she put
her hands to her shoulders and bent her knees. In a stringy
voice she sang—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m a little Prairie Flower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Growing wilder every hour!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No one here to care about me—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m as wild as wild can be!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she put one hand on the top of her head, and the
other on her hip. Jigging up and down to the music of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
the piano, she began to rotate on her toes. The frayed
voice continued—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m a little patchwork quilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All my edges trimmed in gilt!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No one here to cuddle with me—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m as cuddly as can be!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was loud, determined clapping, and Daisy ran
off the floor, her face suffused with blushes.</p>

<p>“Perfectly grand, dear,” said one of the guests. “So
much sweeter than the <em>first</em> time you gave it.”</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> won’t last,” said Beulah, looking at Daisy who
had returned to the room and was holding someone’s
hand, obviously searching the face of her friend for signs
of approval. “It won’t last—I’ve been all through it.”</p>

<p>In the alcove, six musicians wearing short red skirts,
white blouses, white silk stockings and red sandals, were
holding their instruments in readiness. They were camping
among themselves, though the one with the clarinet
looked just a trifle uncomfortable. Drewena asked them
to play a slow drag and they began “Mood Indigo,” the
harpsichordist tapping her red sandal on the side of her
chair, each musician looking oddly like his instrument.
Drewena favored a tempered arrangement of popular
music in the modern idiom. For a simplified expression
of this type of instrumentation she had chosen the curious
grouping of harpsichord, vibraphone, harp, bassoon,
clarinet and drums. She felt that any brass, even muted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
would destroy the exotic, passionate tenor of the music
achieved by the combination of strings and reeds (the
drums having been modulated by casings) and affected
also by the arranger, who had found the predominant
oriental theme from listening to Drewena herself at the
piano.</p>

<p>Some of the dancers walked idly, in as slow a tempo
as possible. Others, however, flew around the floor in a
febrile reaction to the sometimes sweet, sometimes wild
expression of the orchestra. Carrie’s popularity was noticeable.
She flew from partner to partner. But her
dancing was a little heavy, and her large, moist eyes followed
Miriam.</p>

<p>Drewena held on to Miriam tightly, preferring to be
led.</p>

<p>“Your arm is like a rock, Miriam,” she whispered.</p>

<p>This winter idyll was drenched in an arbor of delicate
flowers that grew from the basketball scents of the
dancers. A cloth seemed to cover Miriam’s eyes; but as
she opened them, it was Drewena’s white-tinted hair that
confused her. The soft waves and ringlets covered
Miriam’s arm and the paths that had intrigued her so
long were now undivided. Nevertheless, as she breathed
of Drewena’s cheek, that which had been unrevealed
before came swiftly in an explicable panic. She stopped
in the middle of the floor. Her mouth was dry.</p>

<p>“I’d better prepare for my act,” she said quite suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>Without a word Drewena broke from her, and Miriam
followed her quick steps through the archway.</p>

<p>“How irresponsible you are to-night, my Miriam,” she
breathed, a grave smile darkening her eyes. Then she
called Tai.</p>

<p>The child ran into the powder room and bowed reverently
before her.</p>

<p>“You will obey my friend for a trick,” she said. “It
will not take long.” She placed her hand for a second on
his shoulder before she left.</p>

<p>“It will be fun, Tai,” said Miriam, noting the child’s
frightened look.</p>

<p>Tai bowed again.</p>

<p>“I shall do as you bid, mistress,” he whispered, his
piquant face quite solemn.</p>

<p>Just then a footman entered with a good hemp rope.
Miriam rapidly explained the routine of the act, asked
the man if his shoulders were strong, gave a simple instruction
to Tai, finishing just as the orchestra ceased.
The second number was being announced as she returned
to the drawing room.</p>

<p>Someone screamed very faintly and Docky looked at
Beulah; for, radiant with smiles and dressed in long
white tights, Sophie posed in the doorway, a wild-looking
pigeon in her hand. She began to pivot slowly.</p>

<p>Docky raised her scented handkerchief to her nose.</p>

<p>“<em>Pee-yoo!</em>” she said softly. “Here comes the pigeon-woman!
She’s gone pervert on us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Beulah, and began to hum. “‘<i>We’re
camping to-night on the old campground.</i>’”</p>

<p>A person near them who was dressed in a hoopskirt
made in the shape of a bell, stood up, the bell chiming
once, twice, before she adjusted her bodice.</p>

<p>“Your clapper rings indiscriminately,” said Beulah,
in a mild tone.</p>

<p>“It is rusty from lack of use, my sweet,” replied
Angela, who was an undertaker.</p>

<p>“It is atrophied,” said Docky. “But let’s watch the
dance.”</p>

<p>Sophie, who had waited until all attention was centered
upon her, now leaped from the doorway, flinging
out the pigeon which was tied to her wrist by a string.
Upon alighting, one of her thin legs bent under her, then
she began to dance. She pirouetted and waved her flabby
hips while the bird tried desperately to escape. Once it
descended upon her head and lifted the transformation.
The guests had a fleeting glimpse of a pink, bald dome.
Occasionally Sophie’s joints cracked. The effect was
macabre.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” said Beulah. “If <em>my</em> bones were in that
condition, I’d have brought my little can of lubricating
oil. She positively drowns out the orchestra!”</p>

<p>“‘Little’ can, did you say?” timidly questioned Daisy,
who had rejoined the group.</p>

<p>Beulah did not turn her head. Only the bulges on her
neck seemed to stiffen and bulge out further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>But Sophie was now in difficulty. The pigeon had
become terrified and was jerking at the string. All pretense
of dancing stopped and Sophie stood there, feebly
waving her arms. Pitying her, Drewena stepped to her
side, closed one hand gently around the panicky bird
and slipped the noose from its leg. Out in the dim corridor
she opened a window, touched her cheek to the bird’s
soft, rumpled feathers and, with a sigh, tossed it into the
darkness.</p>

<p>Miriam had returned to the powder room when Sophie
came in, near to hysteria, weeping.</p>

<p>“Oh, heavens!” she cried, while the mascara streamed
down her cheeks. “It stooled on me!” And she wiped the
top of her bare head with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing—a seagull once did the same for
me,” said Miriam. “You can’t get it off that way. Why
don’t you stick your head under the shower?”</p>

<p>“You’re insulting,” said Sophie, drying her eyes.</p>

<p>Miriam left the room in disgust.</p>

<p>Another number was on. Carrie, her fingers fan-shaped
over her heart, was singing “<cite>Mother Macree</cite>” in
a soft voice, high and clear. The strange tonal quality
was like that of a contralto.</p>

<p>Drewena was accompanying her. And along the rows
of gossips there was now complete silence. Miriam noticed
that both Beulah and Docky were holding handkerchiefs
to their eyes, and when the last words—“God
keep you and bless you, Mother Macree” trailed off,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Miriam watched a solid, tremulous emotion sweep the
crowd. Only Kate, openly defiant to any sentiment,
poured a drink down her throat and looked at the others
with disdain.</p>

<p>This time, as they danced, Miriam sneaked the footman
in through the back, and hoisted him to the long
beam, one end of which lay in shadow. Once more, she
whispered instructions to her assistant, then went for
Tai. The music ceased and she could hear Drewena
quieting the crowd.</p>

<p>Then Miriam entered the room. She did not walk with
the air of one experienced in drag, but her stalking,
feline movements seemed even more proper. Several
paces behind her came Tai, a rope over one tiny shoulder,
his eyes lowered. He still wore the golden tunic and
it gleamed against his little body as he held out the rope
to Miriam. She took it, coiling it sailor-fashion on the
floor, then hurled one end to the ceiling where it held, in
a rim of shadow. Immediately Tai grabbed it and climbed
upward to the beam, apparently on a rope which was in
no way supported. Only the magician could see the
tensed form of the footman holding the slight weight of
the child. Then Tai disappeared. Miriam lifted her arms
and the rope fell in waves over her shoulders. She
dropped it, turned to the crowd and solemnly picked up
her train. Tai, smiling and bowing, ran forth from its
folds, and held out his arms to Drewena.</p>

<p>The crowd was charmed; but Drewena, furious, caught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
up the child and hurrying with him through the corridor,
took him into his own room and laid him upon his own
bed.</p>

<p>For a moment her hot cheek rested against the child
who petted her, saying nothing. Then she swept into the
powder room where she knew she would find Miriam.
Still furious, she faced her friend.</p>

<p>“Miriam,” she cried, “that was a coarse trick.” Her
eyes were narrowed and a drop of blood was welling out
of the corner of her lip where she had bitten herself.
“What made you do it?”</p>

<p>Miriam inhaled the smoke of her cigarette.</p>

<p>“We don’t think alike, Drewena,” she said reflectively
at last. “There was nothing coarse in the act. It is
a good trick.”</p>

<p>“Under your skirts, Miriam!” said Drewena, her deep
blue eyes watching her friend intensely.</p>

<p>Miriam shrugged.</p>

<p>“You and I have a different attitude toward such
things, I fear. I hope the child feels the way I do about
it. He is quite innocent—as apparently am I.” Then for
an instant Miriam’s eyes became colder than Drewena’s.
“Of course, I cannot help, nor can I control your interpretations.”
A dark, ugly vein showed vertically now in
the center of Miriam’s forehead. Drewena’s white velvet
gown seemed to turn blood-red before her.</p>

<p>Even in her own anger, Drewena was amazed. Surely
these could not be the features of her friend! She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
watched Miriam as she turned and walked to the ottoman
where she sat down, breathing heavily. A tremor passed
through her body and she sat, looking straight ahead.
Fascinated, Drewena saw the vein in Miriam’s forehead
diminish at last and her features become natural again.
A little frightened, she went over and put her hand on
the shoulder of her friend.</p>

<p>“It’s just that I love both of you so much, Miriam,”
she said. “I was jealous of you both. Please, forgive me.”
Her hand was trembling. “And now,” she added, trying
to compose herself, “I must announce Kate’s dance.
Won’t you come out?—she dances divinely.”</p>

<p>“Later, Drewena,” Miriam said in a despondent voice.
And when Drewena had gone, still looking disturbed,
Miriam lay down on her back on the couch and stared at
the ceiling with both eyes open wide. Her thoughts were
jumbled and confused in this strange atmosphere. She
had felt singular reactions. Desires that were new to her
had come upon her without warning. Were her concepts
changing? Or had they lain dormant, awaiting only the
right moment to make her aware of another facet in her
individuality?... And did this constitute a shame to
God? Should the mind reject what the spirit had planted?...
Was this not a possibility for every man, as well as
the necessity for the cultivated group outside?... It
was obscure to Miriam, lying there. Her mind was tired
from these perplexing questions. Such problems as these
charged without apparent reason. She stood up, held the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
sides of her head which now ached violently. Slowly she
went to the doorway in time to hear Drewena announce
Kate’s dance.</p>

<p>The crowd applauded vigorously and Miriam could
feel again the mass excitement.</p>

<p>“As usual,” continued Drewena, “Kate has adapted
a native dance-ritual to her own choreography. To-night
she will interpret the fire dance of a tribe of Andean
people.”</p>

<p>Drewena stepped back as Patsy came from the corridor
with a smoldering, perfumed brazier which she
placed upon the floor, now cleared for a space in the
center. The music began, the muted drums became more
prominent, and Kate walked from the shadows of the
alcove to the brazier, standing quietly beside it, her eyes
lifted upward, watching the smoke, her hands palm outward
before her. There was a leather strap around her
forehead and a leather wristlet above the left hand. On
her upper arm was a metal band which had the dull gleam
of copper.</p>

<p>The high knee movement as she circled the brazier
showed the control and discipline of her deeply tanned
legs, and the supple flexibility of a professional dancer.
Her bare feet slapped stiffly against the wooden floor as
she continued to circle the smoke which was now rising
like a slender blue pillar. As she went round the coals,
her body rotated while circling, so that at times she faced
the low flames and at others had her back to them, her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
body always arched, her circled head often coming
close to the flickering brazier. A soft, faun-colored wrap
that looked like chamois swung from Kate’s waist; but
on one side it had been cut in from the hips where the
fine webbing of her dark jockstrap covered her.</p>

<p>Among the excited watchers, none was more affected
than Beulah. She kept wiping her mouth and whispering,
“My God!” to Docky. Docky, however, for once, was too
fascinated to reply.</p>

<p>Intoxicated by the wild music and by the incense
which now pervaded the room, even more by the dance
itself, Kate continued her steps with more abandon, her
copper body whirling with such rapidity that she seemed
to be weaving amid the smoke, making it catch her enthusiasm
as it leaned toward her at every angle until it
spiraled upward as though part of the dance. A bolo
knife with a polished bone handle rested against the
nearby wall and Kate leaped toward it, picked it up
swiftly and fastened the looped thong around her wrist.
Then as the song of the Firebird<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> grew wilder, she swung
the heavy, shining blade as though cutting her way
through vines and wet, tall grass, until the knife sang in
the air and Kate’s slim, powerful body weaved from side
to side in her savage desire to get once more to the
flames. Her teeth were drawn back as though fighting
with intangible yet formidable spirits, and her handsome
face was set in a perfect mask of determination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
to get to her own beckoning god—the crimson soul of the
flame—life-giving and protecting. At last she reached
the genie of the fire-bowl, her face, arms and belly
streaming with sweat, the bolo knife held rigidly over her
head and her left hand supporting the sinews of the wrist
which held it.</p>

<p>This time, instead of circling the brazier, she leaped
over it, held herself suspended one fraction of a second
before she dropped lightly on the other side, wheeled
instantly and repeated the floating movement until the
blur of her body became one with the smoke. Suddenly,
to the horror of the guests, there was a soft whisper, like
fire through damp reeds, and the odor of burning hair
mixed with the scent of the pitch. As the crowd held its
breath sharply, Kate let out a fierce, sensuous shout of
triumph, and whirled in eccentric half-turns into the
shadows of the alcove....</p>

<p>There was no applause. The crowd was stunned by
this amazing, painful exhibition into deep silence. Docky
abstractedly removed and wiped her glass eye again, and
Beulah dabbed futilely at her aging face. But their
attention was now quickly drawn to the corner where
Roberta had been sitting. She was standing in such an
imperious manner that everyone turned toward her in
astonishment. The broken rays from a chandelier nearby
revealed her beautiful, tragic face as she said with the
elegance of contempt, “And now—let <em>me</em> speak!” Her
resonate voice filled the deep silence, and she crossed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
the floor to a place where she could face the crowd more
fully.</p>

<p>Rather nervously, Drewena hurried to her and whispered
something; but Roberta’s desperate expression
stopped her from speaking further and she drew back,
more than ever perplexed. At this, Miriam, watching the
blue fox muff attentively, walked quietly to Roberta
until her eyes said, “Stop!” which Miriam did, a few
paces away.</p>

<p>Then, in level voice and without gesture, never taking
her eyes from Miriam’s face, Roberta said—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There on the sheets, my lad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With small gold arms and hair tossed back</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Yet still I’m older, perhaps weary, and some sad.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was a buzz of disapproval as Roberta finished.
“Well,” said Beulah, “we may have <em>lived</em> in our time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
but we <em>never</em> carried on like <em>that</em>! In those pastel days,”
and she tapped Docky’s arm with her fan, parting her
lips with a snap, “we <em>did</em> carry on a bit—but this is <em>too</em>
much! I feel like entering the philanthropies. They’re
so much quieter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Docky, “I tried it once. But it’s too
expensive, Beulah. And don’t expect, dear, too much of
your personality. We’re getting wrinkles. Soon the lovelies
won’t <em>look</em> at us for less than a dollar! How your
quarter has worked as long as it has, is beyond me!”</p>

<p>Roberta had returned to the solitude of her corner
when there was a terrified screech from Patsy, and Rio,
completely drunken, in servant’s skirts held high above
his knees, lurched into the drawing room. He stood there
just inside the doorway, swaying and looking around at
the gathering.</p>

<p>“Whores!” he shouted stridently, raising one heavy
brown arm in his anger. “You lousy, campy sons-of-bitches!”
He forced his risqué Robin Hood hat down to
his ears, his shoulders nearly popping out of his dress,
and his great legs encased in red football stockings which
were rolled just beneath his hairy knees. Then he saw
Miriam looking at him without amusement as she leaned
against the piano. Rio walked slowly to her, his arms
hanging like lead. As he approached, Miriam did not
stir and there was a contemptuous look upon her face.
Rio moved his lips in an obscene gesture and pretended
to whimper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>“Could a old ’ooman show ’ee the sights o’ Cooney
Island? I’ll do no traffic with ’ee.”</p>

<p>Miriam smiled, for in his hatred Rio had mimicked
his character with perfection. Even the crowd began to
think it was a camp when suddenly, without warning,
Rio struck Miriam who fell slowly to the floor. Drewena
noticed that she looked like Tai, the way she was curled.
With a low scream, Drewena ran swiftly from the room
while Rio looked on with contempt. But his expression
changed as he saw his friend still lying open-mouthed,
a little absent, upon the floor, one slippered foot thrust
out from the folds of the yellow dress.</p>

<p>Drewena now returned silently. She was carrying a
long, gilded whip. She held it firmly in her delicate
hands, the barbs away from her, ready to be snapped.
As Rio bent over his friend, he started to kneel. But
before his knee was completely bent, Drewena brought
the thorned end of the gold scourge straight down across
his shoulders, the faint swish modified by Rio’s cry of
pain and surprise; for as the flesh was ripped from his
back there was the sound of crushed bubbles. In his
agony, he rushed at the white-gowned hostess, but Drewena,
as though in a fantastic ballet, dodged him and
pivoted so swiftly that when Rio passed, the wrench and
throb of his sickening pain as he was struck again,
brought forth a groan from everyone in the room. Drewena
stood poised for the next thrust, and her expression
brought Rio on once more, his great hands searching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
for her through his agony. Again she avoided him and
turned to lay the hooked rods into his lacerated flesh.
Rio, in all his bravery could stand no more and fell upon
his face, his arms reaching out like claws. Cool and
mindful of her action, Drewena struck him again until
the blood formed in small pools by his side.</p>

<p>Roberta still stood silently in the shadow of her corner.
Docky, who had been watching her, had seen with her
one alert, keen eye, a single movement and a flash of
steel as Roberta withdrew her hand from her muff, then
returned it stoically when Rio fell.</p>

<p>This time, as Drewena lifted her arm, Miriam sat up.
There was no movement, no shudder from the prone figure
on the floor.</p>

<p>“Wait, Drew!” called Miriam. “Leave the man alone!”</p>

<p>Drewena looked at her incredulously.</p>

<p>“This beast knocked you down,” she said, “and without
reason.”</p>

<p>She turned again to strike, but Miriam arose unsteadily
and held Drewena’s arm.</p>

<p>Drewena dropped the whip.</p>

<p>“Do you, then, consider <em>this</em> more important?” she
asked nodding toward Rio who was still lying quietly,
his blouse in shreds upon his blood-soaked back.</p>

<p>“He is my friend,” said Miriam. “We are going
home.”</p>

<p>“Our rendezvous?” breathed Drewena.</p>

<p>“Will wait,” said Miriam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>Then, kneeling down by the stricken man whose face
showed no expression as she turned it toward her, Miriam
repeated, “It’s Martin, Rio, ... Martin ... we
are going home.” Half lifting, half imploring, Martin
got Rio to his feet, and as the man leaned heavily against
him, they crossed the floor amid the horrified silence
of the crowd.</p>

<p>Then “Boor!” ... “Common!” ... “Stiff!” ...
came to Martin’s ears as he bore the weight of his friend
onward to the doorway. At last, he could stand no more
of it.</p>

<p>“You!” he cried, turning. “You! Leave us alone!—my
friend and me!”</p>

<p>In the hall, Martin looked at Rio’s thrashed back.</p>

<p>“We’d better go to my room,” he said. “Call a cab
for us, Patsy.” And he threw Deane’s coat over Rio....
As they left, they could hear the sound of music and
dancing.</p>

<p>Carrie had gone into hysterics. Her high heel had
caught in her train and ripped it open. She was rushing
to the powder room when Drewena saw her. The
hostess followed her guest through the groups of dancers
and found Carrie on the ottoman, crying brokenly. Drewena
closed and locked the door. Her lips were bitter—to
have revealed herself and lost her caste over a graceless
Polynesian was unbearable! She went through a
hidden paneled doorway into Tai’s room and lightly
kissed his fingers, listening to the sweet sound of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
even breathing. Then opening the door into the corridor,
she called the footman who brought Patsy to her at once.</p>

<p>“We are leaving, Patsy,” she said. “Arrange for an
early departure. We will go to Paris. Cable Jacques to
meet us.”</p>

<p>Patsy bowed.</p>

<p>“May I say ‘thank God,’ Madame? I speak reverently.”</p>

<p>Drewena laughed, and for a moment looked into
Patsy’s faithful eyes.</p>

<p>“Arrange things quickly,” she repeated as the attendant
left.</p>

<p>Again Drewena tiptoed past the sleeping, tired baby
and entered the powder room, closing the panel behind
her and ignoring the pounding on the door.</p>

<p>Carrie still cried, her tears dampening the golden pillows
of the couch.</p>

<p>“Miriam left without asking me to dance,” she kept
on sobbing.</p>

<p>Drewena picked her up bodily and making a cradle
out of her own slender arms, held the unhappy girl.
Singing a soft, melodic lullaby, she rocked Carrie, thinking,
“It is time once more, for me to go. Ah, Martin!—indiscriminate
man!—you see beauty only through your
prostitution.... How I envy you!... How I ...”
Drewena’s thick tears clung to her lashes and did not
fall on Carrie who, now rocked asleep, held tightly to
Drewena’s comforting breast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XVII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>On the low coffee table in front of Deane was a
bowl of yellow roses. She had broken off one of the
blossoms and was slowly, abstractedly pulling it to
pieces. Listlessly she allowed the golden petals to fall
to the floor.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me of Drew’s love letter earlier,
Martin?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It was an invitation,” he answered. “I shouldn’t
have shown it at all.”</p>

<p>Deane lit a cigarette nervously.</p>

<p>“But what did you do?—I mean—oh!” she cried out,
hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Martin shook his head but did not speak.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued Deane, “you insist on meeting
him in the Bowery.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Martin nodded.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t like Drew to go to such a terrible place.
Why did you agree to such a rendezvous?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, except that he sounded sincere and
almost desperate over the phone.”</p>

<p>“How <em>did</em> he sound?” asked Deane. “Remember, I
know him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>“Cool on the surface, but determined,” answered Martin,
“and worried—no, not worried; just rather desperate.”</p>

<p>“You <em>can’t</em> go!” cried Deane. “I’ve been driven
through the place at night. It’s terrifying; a street of
yellow lanterns, and figures huddled in shadow like
fallen bric-a-brac.”</p>

<p>“I must go,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Won’t you stay, for me?”</p>

<p>Martin pressed his hand against his temple.</p>

<p>“Yes, Deane,” he answered at last.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” she said. “There is something cruel in
the air to-night.” Then, relieved, she asked, “What happened
to Rio?”</p>

<p>Martin regarded her so long and steadily that she
flushed, looking a little frightened. At last he answered,
“The driver helped me get him into the cab and he slept
all the way to my place. When I got him on the bed with
his shirt off, he awoke in great pain and I smelt a curious
odor that came from his back. I’m sure the thorns of the
whip held some kind of drug. Rio said they felt like fishhooks
and that he was dizzy a moment before he fell on
the floor. It’s odd the way Drew is able to handle him.
They fought like two dancers.”</p>

<p>Deane’s face was white and she spoke quietly, as
though faint.</p>

<p>“I believe you enjoyed it. How can you be so impersonal?”</p>

<p>Martin put his chin in his hands. How could two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
people, close in passion, united in mind, lapse into these
subtle quarrels? There was no basis. The quarrel was an
excuse for something deeper.</p>

<p>Analyzing himself, Martin tried to find the fault within
him. Coldly, impersonally, he reviewed the scene, not
sparing himself in any way. It was impossible. Deane
had subtly forced the argument. Deeply, actually, she
had been the aggressor. Martin accepted this with no
pleasure. Deane would not intentionally wound him.
<em>Not intentionally.</em> The phrase gathered meaning. Unconsciously
she had created the picture. Why? Nothing
on the surface. Nothing of which she was conscious.
Rather, some deep-seated demand for pain. Pain for
herself and for him. A hunger to wound and be wounded.
Martin shook his head helplessly. From his chair he
could see Deane sitting quietly serene, apparently indifferent.
No. It was a simulated indifference. A strange
play with no tenable motive. She must be as aware of
the chasm between them as he. Out of this isolation she
was drawing something. Something that fed her. It was
inexplicable to Martin, for Deane was not a tyrant. She
was, however, feminine. And now, the roots of all womanhood
shone grimly through. Martin wondered, hesitated,
and spoke.</p>

<p>“Deane, are you well? I mean,” he continued, “is it
the time of the moon, you know?”</p>

<p>Deane was casual.</p>

<p>“Yes, Martin.” Her voice was tolerant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>“Well, then,” he said, “I should have been more
considerate.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be impossible,” Deane exclaimed. “My condition
has nothing at all to do with our discussion.”</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to believe, Deane, that it has everything
to do with it.”</p>

<p>“That is ridiculous,” she answered, flushing. “It isn’t
nice.”</p>

<p>Martin looked at her closely. Deane’s eyes were implacable.
Cold, glassed-in, the poisonous shell moved
around her. He could not reach her. He thought quickly,
fantastically, in his unhappiness. The period. The time
of the moon. The time eggs swell and burst into a live
stream. In his vision he watched a flood of red, elliptical
objects swing in a gigantic arch from heaven to earth.
Rolling and whispering through the dark air, they poured
in a fast tide past his aching eyes. Redolent of life, acrid
with blood, they cried from the great sky-womb into the
whirling land. Symbolic of woman’s supremacy, the scarlet
bank lightened, faded and died, that it might live
again.</p>

<p>“Deane!” cried Martin. “I have seen the secret.”</p>

<p>“What secret, Martin?”</p>

<p>“The secret that you have a secret. That you have a
secret that I will never know. That no man will ever
know. It is your earth-quality, your heritage as a woman.
A glory and a pride, and I have confused it.”</p>

<p>Deane turned her dark, lovely eyes toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked, and a tiny nerve
close to her mouth quivered.</p>

<p>Martin laughed. He had the key. He had turned the
key and the glass had broken. Gone was the poisonous
mist and doubt from Deane’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I mean that there is a completeness in woman that
man will never have,” he said, with quiet conviction. “A
secret that man will never fully understand. A secret that
women are not aware of—consciously. A pact of woman
in the woman that is not revealed until the life-flow
moves from their bodies. A pact so complete, so magnificent,
that man takes on his true perspective—an
interloper.”</p>

<p>Deane turned and hugged him to her. Her hair fell
over his shoulder—burned him.</p>

<p>“You’re crazy,” she said. But there was warmth in
her voice, and love, and some belief.</p>

<p>“I’m not crazy,” said Martin, kissing her. He held
her proudly, and looked at her and kissed her again.
He was arrogant of his weakness and proud of her
strength. He was that way, whether he was wrong, or
right. And there was the man, and there was the woman.</p>

<p class="tb">It was quite dark and raining when Martin left
Deane’s. The wind, cold and full of smoke, sifted into
his nostrils. Halfway down the block he pressed against
the wall, partly out of the storm, and lit a cigarette.
The glare of the match showed his calm features. Shielding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
his cigarette from the downpour with his hand, he
walked slowly toward the Bowery.</p>

<p>As he turned into Third Avenue he became, once
more, aware of a madman’s world. Little dwarfs with
sour, twisted faces uplifted in the rain implored with
mocking smiles a cigarette; and when he gave it he
could feel the jeers carried after him by the wind. Soon
he went into Bowery Lane and a blind man stumbled
into him.</p>

<p>“You’re not real,” said Martin. “Don’t ever believe
that you’re real.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried the man, tapping the street with his
stick. “You scoundrel,” he went on, “let me go! I’ll call
the damned police, curse them!” And he walked on
swiftly, tapping his cane through the mist.</p>

<p>Martin continued along the Bowery until he saw a
saloon. He crossed the street and went inside wondering
if he had time for a drink. Looking at his watch he
saw that he was far too early for his appointment with
Drew.</p>

<p>“Step up, Mac,” called out a fat, red-faced gentleman
at the bar. “Name it, and I’ll buy it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Martin. “I’ll have a Bass Ale.”</p>

<p>“To my little lady I left in the west!” said the florid
man, a few tears trickling down the side of his pudgy
nose. “Ain’t that right, Allie?” he continued, turning to
a slab-headed man next to him.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” replied Allie, looking Martin over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>The three men lifted their glasses. Allie belched and
took a package of baking soda from his pocket. He
dumped a teaspoonful into the remainder of his beer
and stirred it. Swallowing this concoction with some effort,
he turned to Martin.</p>

<p>“It takes a goddam acid out,” he said earnestly. “It
don’t give a gas like a plain goddam beer—” he stopped
to belch again.</p>

<p>Martin nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>“I must be going now,” he said, “but before I do,
kindly have a drink on me.”</p>

<p>Allie insisted on a third which Martin thanked him
for, but put down untouched after seeing the fellow cleverly
add an astonishing portion of “mickey” to it.</p>

<p>The men were sullen as he said goodnight, and a little
way down the street Martin knew he was being followed
by them. He ducked around a corner and into a doorway
for a moment, but they were even closer behind him as
he started on. Ahead of him four men were huddled on
a stoop out of the rain, the light from a yellow lamp
streaking their greasy features. Martin thought momentarily
of Deane’s weird description, then looking back
and seeing Allie and his friend closing in upon him, he
went directly to the little group on the doorstep and
addressed them earnestly.</p>

<p>“It’s cold,” he said. “A smoke for the soul’s sake,” he
continued, handing some cigarettes around, one at a
time, to the greedy, shaking fingers. One cigarette was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
now left in the case, and one man was left out. “I just
came down from Heaven, sir,” Martin said to the man
quite solemnly. “They told me that worldly goods were
without blessing unless freely given.” He handed the
cigarette to the man, who backed slightly away, but who
accepted it nevertheless. All the men lit up and formed
a thinly protective group against Martin, who heard one
of them whisper, “The kid’s cracked. Hope he ain’t got
no ‘shiv.’ Religion guys go fast wit’ a knife.”</p>

<p>Another, a giant in a white shirt and dark coat said,
“Don’t squawk. Lookit a kid’s face in a lamp. God!—a
smoke is sweet! Lookit a kid.” They all studied Martin
whose uplifted face and exalted eyes seemed far
away from them. They talked on quietly among themselves
as the rain streaked down Martin’s cheeks
unnoticed.</p>

<p>By this time Allie and his companion had reached
the little group.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pal,” said Allie, addressing Martin.</p>

<p>Martin did not answer, but turned to his new friends.</p>

<p>“These men are evil,” he said in a deep, resonant tone.
“The very lips of the Devil are among us!” Martin lifted
his voice into an hysterical pitch as he noticed with
curiosity the strange effect of his words upon the men
about him.</p>

<p>The giant with the coat carefully hung the dripping
garment on a railing, and the dirty shirt and muscular
reach of his arms showed in the yellow, muckish light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>“Amen!” he cried, and advanced slowly toward Allie.</p>

<p>“Amen, amen!” echoed through the group behind him.
The little fat man ran crying into the heavy rain; but it
was with singular detachment that Martin watched the
giant he had converted, strike tirelessly the broken form
of Allie until the body was dumped, face down, in the
swirling length of gutter.</p>

<p>Martin strode to the hard-breathing giant, placed his
hand on the fellow’s damp shoulder and said softly, “It
was a message! It has been answered.” And he went
silently into the rain again.</p>

<p>A square away he paused and looked at a large clock.
Once more he saw that in his impatience he was ahead
of time. The cold rain had now penetrated the shoulders
of his coat and Martin felt the steam rising from his hot
body. What did Drew want in this undesirable section?
Accustomed as Martin was to certain ways of life, he
could not help but feel the disease of this unnatural
quarter. He stood on the corner of Bowery and Pell—the
Chinese street—a mimeographed edition of its former
tong retreat and underground silence. It was true,
a small group of thin-lipped, older men with their discreet
smoke-houses and their hatchet-men survived. But
the list was growing smaller so swiftly that the aroma of
opium now had a death-like stench. The neon lights of
New America had quickly dispelled the shadows and
the soft lanterns of oriental intrigue. Martin looked
across the street toward the little theater on the corner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
It was half hidden by rain, but he could faintly see the
line of trade in front of it. As the fog deepened, sailing
lower under Brooklyn Bridge, Martin could hear the
tangled music of a victrola somewhere nearby. The singsong
lady of Shanghai was mute behind the stalls. But
her Tiao-wu chords brought about by twangy, cut-off
strings and yellow pipes as high as reeds can go, caused
him to reflect upon the ancient wailing destined to wail
forever....</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt his arm seized and the hard mouth
of a gun pressed into his back.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a mistake,” said a harsh, low voice.</p>

<p>Martin dropped swiftly on his hands and brought his
heels upward, barely missing the other’s chin. The fellow
chuckled.</p>

<p>“Still good with your feet, eh, Martin,” he said.
“Damn your French foot! It nearly got me!”</p>

<p>Martin squatted by the gutter as he rinsed his stinging
hands in the pure flow of rainwater. Getting up, he
rubbed his sore shoulders.</p>

<p>“You’ve gone to hell, Duke,” he said. “You weren’t
this bad when I left Panama. You should have stuck to
reefers. What is it now?”</p>

<p>“The Duke” drew his fingers slowly under his nose,
then brought up his coat collar to hide his face, pretending
to shake.</p>

<p>Martin smiled, shook hands with his friend whose
uproarious laughter followed this act, and pulled him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
along to a tea-shop on Pell Street. Inside, he ordered
coffee while the Duke took Chow Mein with tea.</p>

<p>Martin leaned on the table.</p>

<p>“It’s good to see you,” he said. “Heroin can’t hurt you,
apparently.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it can,” said the Duke, nervously pressing a
small blue butterfly which was tattooed on his wrist.
“Sometimes it hits me like dynamite, and I’ll go on a
mad rob for a dollar. But it’s worse when I get cop-fever.
Then I go back to my room—Christ!” he said, wiping
his face. “Sometimes I crawl back of the dresser. Say—maybe
I get peddled the wrong junk?” He looked at
Martin hopefully.</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin, “the stuff is all right. You know
your contact.” But he was beginning to see certain signs
in The Duke’s eyes even now. “Get the tea down,” he
continued, “and we’ll move out. Where’s your room?”</p>

<p>With a grotesque, frightening look, the Duke sat up.</p>

<p>“I’m cut short,” he said, the sweat breaking out on
his face. “God, Mart!—get me back to my room! Jesus!—it’s
the snow!... Cut off the cold wind, Mart!—it’s
down on my head!” The Duke’s white face seemed blue
in the yellow light. “God, Mart!... Mate!—ah!” he
cried, the perspiration running from his forehead in
streams.</p>

<p>Martin snapped his fingers at the Chinese waiter who
was watching The Duke with placid, averted eyes, took
a bill from his pocket and laid it on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“Quickly—where does my friend live?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I do not know, sir,” the waiter smiled.</p>

<p>Martin added another bill to his account.</p>

<p>“Where might he live?” he asked soberly, adding,
“when the man is sick, we are all brothers.”</p>

<p>“I would not live against that proverb,” said the
waiter. “The hotel is directly across the street—there—”
The Chinaman pointed to a large bulb, glowing, but
marked with age. “His room may be ascertained at the
desk,” he added, bowing low.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Martin, as The Duke got to his feet,
the horrified turmoil within pressing out through his
eyes. He clung to the arm of his friend, but once inside
the hotel, tried to dash to the stairs. He was stopped,
however, by a quiet little gray-headed Chinese clerk.</p>

<p>“Let me get him up,” Martin said to the man. “I’ll see
about his rent later.”</p>

<p>“We do not want Mr. Duke,” said the clerk mildly. He
was wearing octagonal glasses which were useless but for
their dignity.</p>

<p>“Then I must ask you for his room for only a few
minutes,” continued Martin.</p>

<p>“A woman waits for him also,” said the Chinaman.</p>

<p>Martin became cold, as though he were facing a crisis
of his own.</p>

<p>“Please show me his room,” he insisted, and perhaps
it was his unequivocal stare that made the Chinese submit
graciously to his demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>The cranky elevator stopped and Martin helped The
Duke into the hall.</p>

<p>As they approached his room a slim woman—a beautiful
Eurasian, so Martin judged by the hall’s dim light,
stepped from the door and ran at him.</p>

<p>“Fag!” she cried, as she tried to strike his face.</p>

<p>Martin wrapped her long hair around his wrist, and
holding his friend and the woman, entered the room.</p>

<p>The Duke ran to the window, looking out.</p>

<p>“I’ll jump!” he said. “This rat-hole’s too crowded.
It’ll call the police.” He stood, bending down to the sill.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Martin, watching him closely, his
hand still wrapped in the beautiful long blue hair of the
squirming girl.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll hide from them,” cried the Duke, and he
began to crawl under the carpet.</p>

<p>The Eurasian, slant-eyed, watched him. Then quickly
she turned to Martin.</p>

<p>“Babee!” she said, in a Dutch accent, her yellow eyes
lifted to his. “Come with me. Let my hair go.”</p>

<p>Martin saw that The Duke, now flat under the carpet
was quiet, and he loosened his own wrist from the
woman’s soft hair.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It is Siedred!”</p>

<p>“A mongrel boy,” he said, his teeth closing and unclosing.
“Where do you wish me to go?”</p>

<p>“To my room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>“In this hall?”</p>

<p>“It is so.”</p>

<p class="tb">Martin looked once more at the shaking body under
the carpet and took the girl by the waist.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said.</p>

<p>The Eurasian led him from the room, across the hall
and to another door which she unlocked silently. Once
inside, she turned the lock again and laid the key upon
a table.</p>

<p>Breathing without restraint, she slipped her blouse
over her head and snapped the buttons from her skirt.
As she looked at Martin, her breast filled, then fell, then
rose again until Martin, impatient, lifted her and tossed
her on the bed, laughing.</p>

<p>“I love you,” cried the native girl as she felt his
pointed tongue.</p>

<p>“You are so hot,” replied Martin. “This is not love.”</p>

<p>“It is, it is!” the woman insisted. “Touch me again!”</p>

<p>“Siedred,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Siedred.” He pulled the long cord of the lamp which
hung above them. There was a frantic sound of broken
clothes, of sighs too distressing, of a single, smothered
scream.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” Siedred cried.</p>

<p>And out in the corridor, besieged by following tears
and moans, Martin crept down the stairs into the street.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
Unquestioning, he waited before the tiny theater for
Drew’s arrival.</p>

<p>As Martin watched, a limousine drew up before the
theater and stopped. Drew, his friend, stepped out. He
made no sign, but pulled down his hat and turned up
the collar of his coat, bringing it under his chin. Then
he observed the trade, beckoning at last to a roughly
dressed youngster with golden skin and frightened eyes.
As he helped the lad into his car, he closed the door
upon him, and turning to Martin who stood so quietly
in the rain, Drew removed his hat, keeping it off until
the water spilled over his blond, pinned hair. His lips
spelled “Night.” He bowed slightly and entered the car,
closing the door as Martin started toward him. As the
limousine passed, Martin could see his mocking, tired
face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XVIII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>In his room Martin laid his head upon his desk. He
wondered about Roberts, his magnificence at the drag,
the mad poem intended for himself. Confused by these
thoughts, he fell asleep. He dreamed that he was in the
bow of a shining canoe, spinning down a great white
length of rapids. In the stern of the boat two men were
fighting. Rio, and the giant with the white, rain-soaked
shirt were striking each other fiercely. Above them hovered
the spirit of Freud, smiling at both of them and
holding a battered text in one hand and a setscrew in the
other which were apparently to be awarded to the victor.
Roberts, however, in the form of mist, obstructed the
blows of the fighters until the two gladiators became
entangled and suddenly dissolved. The spirit of Freud
withdrew hastily, while the adviser, with a faint smile at
Martin, sat down in the boat as it rotated toward destruction.</p>

<p>Martin awakened from the dream with a somber expression.
Then he shook his head and laughed.</p>

<p>“What a symbol!” he exclaimed to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>The deep whistles of a ship ready to sail seemed to
agitate him and he lowered his head upon the desk again.
He thought of Paris, where Drew was going, of Tai with
him, and of Deane seeing him off. Once more Martin fell
asleep, this time in a world uninhabited by dreams.</p>

<p class="tb">This was true for the most part, for Tai was playing
in Drew’s suite, while Pat attended him as though he were
a little saint.</p>

<p>In the great lounge of the liner Drew was talking seriously
with Deane.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand Martin,” he said. “And I must
confess that it is impossible for me to live within his
orbit.”</p>

<p>“You dislike him so?” Deane raised her dark eyes.</p>

<p>Drew shook his head.</p>

<p>“I can’t connect that term with him,” he answered. “I
loved him very deeply at one time. Now, I hate him, or
rather, am frightfully jealous of him.”</p>

<p>“Of his sins?” asked Deane.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Drew irritably. “He has no sins. He
has none because he does not believe the things he does
are wrong.” Drew touched a handkerchief to his head.
“Martin,” he continued, “could destroy the world and
it would not be sinful. He is selfish, but because he knows
it, there is no feeling of blame. He’s like a ghost, and all
of the people around him are like ghosts. Even I came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
feel like one. There is no reality about him. Yes,” Drew
sighed, “he is the most physical creature in the world,
and the most untouchable. Oh—I know what you’re
thinking, Deane! And I know I’m just putting on.” Suddenly
Drew stopped and lit a cigarette for Deane and one
for himself.</p>

<p>“I like him the way he is,” said Deane. “I like his
unreality. And he isn’t the way you think he is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>no</em>,” said Drew, arching his eyebrows. “Oh, dear
no!”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” went on Deane quietly, “although I’ve
seen him pretend to have the quality you say he has,
I’m a woman, and I would know. I would rebel.” She
tapped out her cigarette. “Surely, Drew, you can see
that he speculates about himself in order to enjoy his
own pursuits.”</p>

<p>“That may be so,” agreed Drew, somewhat sardonically.
“But I have something of more immediate importance,
Deane. Roberts is not well. I don’t know what
the trouble is, but he has changed terribly in the past
few months. His reaction to Martin is instantaneous and
violent. This may affect you. Please see as little as you
can of him.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Deane with a charming, puzzled frown.
“I’ve felt it too, and sometimes it frightens me.”</p>

<p>“Please come to Paris,” suggested Drew impulsively,
leaning forward and taking both her hands in his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“Sweet Drew,” whispered Deane, “how good you are!
But I love Martin and I need to be with him, I want to
go right away to him. Now. Even now,” She stood up and
held Drew’s arm as they strolled to the promenade.</p>

<p>“Let’s say good-by right here,” she said, her full, red
lips trembling. “I’m about to cry.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t good-by at all, dearest,” said Drew, smiling
gravely. “You know that in spite of anything, we’ll always
be together. Go to Martin now, but remember that
<em>we</em> have the phone, the cable, the secret bond and love
in understanding.” He kissed her on both cheeks and as
Deane turned, she saw that his eyes were misty.</p>

<p>After she had gone, Drew went into Tai’s little room.
The ship was slipping out of the pier and the child
clapped his hands at the movement. Drew lay down on
the couch and laid his arms over his eyes. This!—to happen
for the second time in his life! It was too severe.
There could not be a third. Little Tai approached softly
and kissed the tears away. It was all he knew, and suddenly
Drew smiled.</p>

<p>Before he went on the promenade he looked out
through the darkness and saw the black, rolling water.
He gazed at himself in the mirror and drew a warm
scarf under his dark overcoat. Then he pulled his dark
hat over his forehead, looked steadily at himself once
more and went on deck.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment by a large ventilator as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
saw a young man leaning on the rail, studying the ocean.
The boy’s profile was quaint in the dim overhead lights.
Drew pulled his own hat lower, turned up the collar of
his coat and approached the stranger with unhurried,
gentle steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XIX</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The concert hall quieted. Conversation hushed.</p>

<p>The White Peacock,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> sorrowful and majestic, appeared
in the faint light. Winding through deep white
reeds, brushing through ghostly ferns, he approached.
Wading the moon-puddles, breaking the mist with silver
feathers, he looked at Deane. Holding his white throat
into the stars, moving the fallen petals, he sang to her—sang
a clear, demanding song of his remote, pale island.
Deane shivered under the soft notes, loosening her gown.
The White Peacock, his snowy tail drifting over the
moon-flowers, lifted his scarlet eyes—lifted his eyes
through clouds and placed each strong tone against her....
The music changed tempo. The white bird screamed
shrilly, his bright whistle falling through glissandi of
sound. The exquisite melody rose into the wind, hesitated,
and dropped murmuring into the white sea....
The White Peacock faded in the fluid light, became
distant—Deane, following with her arms the receding
shadow.</p>

<p>The music died. People moved in their chairs and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
subdued whispers grew into applause. The mood was
broken and Deane touched her eyes. She put on a coat
of soft gray fur, adjusted her little tight-fitting blue toque
and carelessly pinned back on her collar a small bunch
of violets which had fallen to her lap during the concert.
As she was rising someone addressed her.</p>

<p>“Then you, too, are fond of modern music?”</p>

<p>Surprised, Deane looked up. Roberts stood before her.</p>

<p>“It was beautiful,” she answered. “Beautiful, and
intimate.”</p>

<p>Roberts smiled in appreciation, acutely aware of the
faint and lovely perfume of her violets.</p>

<p>“Did you come alone, Deane?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the adviser, his voice curiously naive
and youthful, “let me drive you home. I have my car.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the aisle by his side and as they
walked out together the distinguished grace of his movements
and the coloring in his cheeks, still flushed by the
spell of the music, made Deane conscious of the beauty
of a sex that shocked her heart but held her mind; and
in this acceptance every light in her hair and eyes acquired
luminance until she was betrayed—and Roberts
looked, turned blind, and never looked again.</p>

<p>The early darkness of winter had descended and the
streets were brightly lit with red and green lights. Snow,
falling gently, coated the buildings and walks. The
holiday atmosphere—the thought of Christmas, gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
them a feeling of friendliness. They drove over to Fifth
Avenue.</p>

<p>All down the broad expanse of the great boulevard
swept the Yuletide spirit. The thick streams of people,
carrying boxes and parcels wrapped in colored paper,
seemed compact—a constant mass instead of one of
gigantic fluctuation. At the corners they bumped and
jostled each other, frantically trying to retrieve dropped
packages, laughing all the while. There they were, pouring
their laughter and hustle and gay concern over the
Avenue—a huge, comforting block of the world, this infinite
throng.</p>

<p>As Deane and Roberts passed St. Patrick’s Cathedral
they noticed that the doors of the church had been thrown
open—a silent welcome to the holiday crowds. There was
an impression of austere immensity; and over the kneeling
figures which had sought tranquillity within the sacred
vault there shone a great soft radiance, whether
from electric lights or candles on the altar, Deane and
Roberts did not know.</p>

<p>Farther down the Avenue they could hear the muffled
sound of chimes; and as they drew near one of the department
stores the sound became more brilliant until
they noticed that behind the glass of the one window
which ran its entire front length there was nothing but
an illusion of depth in a green-blue sky and two large
gold bells, swinging slowly back and forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>Deane turned to Roberts and was astonished to find
that he was looking at her instead of the lovely window.</p>

<p>“It is as glorious as that other vault we passed,” she
said quietly, amazed at his attitude.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, still regarding her gravely,
“and although beauty, to me, is but a dream gone by—a
vagrant moment—a motion lost before it’s held—oddly,
I find it stationary for one evening.” He paused
and added, looking at her fixedly, “Even within a superb
commercial painting.”</p>

<p>The chiming now covered the air with invisible
shadows. There was an icy wind; and as Deane sensing
its fury within the well-heated car, pulled her coat more
tightly around her shoulders, Roberts again caught the
perfume of the flowers she was wearing, and their fragrance
seemed to him to become as audible—to have a
resonance and vibration quite as definite as the chimes.</p>

<p>They spoke no more but continued down the Avenue
until they came upon a children’s shop with such a pretty
charm about it that Roberts stopped the car. For the
shop’s display there was a miniature snowstorm—a tiny
replica of the one outside which was increasing in density
each moment. Amidst the artificial snow within the
window were artificial children posed in different attitudes.
One small boy had his hand raised against a snowman
as though building him. A little girl stood by, just
watching. And still another boy was stooped as though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
gathering more snow. The scene was such a dainty one
that Roberts looked at it wistfully, with a reserved hunger
that seemed to demand release; and Deane, fascinated,
clasped her hands together. On the street a ragged
boy, walking beside a hulk of a man, stopped for a
moment to look quietly, but in silent despair at these
happy children who played in the snow and wore such
pretty clothes. He stared particularly at the little girl,
with her long, blond curls and piquant face and her little
dress and coat that were like a dream. But the man,
resentful, cuffed the boy’s cheek roughly, pulling him
along. The lad cringed. Deane thought she heard him
cry out once and turned her face away; while Roberts,
who had also witnessed the episode, started the car and
drove on swiftly through the storm.</p>

<p>Near the lower part of the Avenue, just before they
turned off on Deane’s street, they came upon a Christmas
tree which had been set up in the courtyard of a large
apartment hotel. The branches of the pine were straight
and proud; and instead of the usual strings of many-colored
lights which had dressed the other trees along
the boulevard, on this, there were dull points of red
under the boughs, or brilliant ones of green that stood
far out, so awkwardly, that by their very misplacement
the tree appeared to be native and uncut. It was without
tinsel. There was only the snow. The wind and the
shadows did the rest. The unusual reflections dwelt upon
Deane’s face and Roberts turned to her impulsively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>“You are beautiful this evening, Deane,” he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him once more and smiled, although
she was a bit perplexed. For some time she continued to
gaze at him, watching the man, as vivid as the tree itself
against the snow. Then abruptly, the notion came to her
that his temperament might be flexible, and she lifted
her head higher, as though challenging him. Her eyes
were sparkling.</p>

<p>Roberts seemed frightened at first at her audacity and
turned away in embarrassment. Then, looking back to
meet her dancing eyes, he broke into a choppy laugh of
singular amusement which Deane echoed. During the rest
of the drive they were silent; but there was a tenuous
bond of understanding between them; and when they
reached Deane’s apartment, Roberts stopped the engine
and placed his hand lightly on hers.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are a beautiful and an intricate woman,”
he said quietly.</p>

<p>Deane quickly withdrew her hand. She was surprised
at the instantaneous feeling of revulsion which came
over her. There had been no possessiveness in Roberts’
action—no suggestion of desire or intimacy. It had been
the movement of a child. But the contact had chilled her.
What was the quality about him that disturbed her now?
Could it be a strong jealousy of his interest in Martin?
She could see Roberts stiffen in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, with hauteur. “My remark
was entirely impersonal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“I know,” she said gently. Then, annoyed with herself,
she added, “I was thinking of Drew. To-night he
arrives in France. I wonder if it is snowing there.”</p>

<p>The adviser dropped his shoulders.</p>

<p>“It is snowing everywhere,” he said gravely. And as
he assisted Deane out of the car, he repeated, “—everywhere.”</p>

<p>Feeling his wild and plaintive loneliness and his sorrow,
Deane stepped quite close to him, resting her gloved
hand on his sleeve.</p>

<p>“William!” she murmured softly.</p>

<p>For one moment, their antipodal forces swung into
parallel; and, so going, Deane and Roberts smiled
together.</p>

<p class="tb">When Martin came that evening, Deane said to him
at once, “I saw Roberts at the concert and he brought
me home in his car. I liked him better than ever before.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Martin was thoughtful, “I can’t say that I like
it—oh, you needn’t explain his charm! I’m quite aware
of it. But I’m afraid of his mind. I’m afraid of the way
it works, and I wish to God he’d get out of the picture.
It’s getting a little too uncanny—the way he checks on
me.” Martin pulled his chair closer to Deane’s. “I found
out that he tried to block my part-time job. Still, with
all of it,” he continued, “my attitude toward him remains
variable; for underneath his mask lies a real and
secret protest. This protest is limitless—and if I’m right,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
rather beautiful.” Martin laughed shortly. “Odd as it
may be, I’m certain that I’m responsible for many of his
appearances. His sickness, if he <em>is</em> sick, is now abiding
in a perfect culture.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” asked Deane, looking at him with
her large eyes.</p>

<p>“A medium of vicious love engendered by myself.”</p>

<p>Deane laughed without restraint.</p>

<p>“Darling,” she said, taking Martin’s face in her hands,
“you want to be so awfully bad, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Martin smiled with her and she was satisfied, promptly
forgetting the adviser.</p>

<p>“Drew looked very sad when he left, Martin,” she
said. “Tell me—did he go just because of you?”</p>

<p>“Deane,” Martin said quite seriously, “we mustn’t
keep on thinking that all these forces are created by me.”
Martin was pale in the shadows. “That would be a timeless,
horrible thought—a possible eternity. Can anything
be more terrible than eternity? All this action is separate
from myself. It <em>must</em> be. It’s not possible that my
demand has been too much!” He was speaking hoarsely
when Deane put her arms around him.</p>

<p>“Darling,” she whispered, “I understand. Won’t you
love me a little?” By instinct she had given him that temporary
haven where the mind of man retreats after being
frightened by its own infinite possibilities. Deane’s gentle
whisper and her fascinating implication of certain
physical contacts quieted his nerves abruptly and he felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
as though a sweet fire were crossing his spine. He closed
his eyes, and allowing Deane to lead him into the gray-paneled
bedroom, he lay back on the sheets, feeling her
soft hands stroke his skin until he shivered.</p>

<p>“Delightful boy—delicious boy,” she said, her voice
trembling and growing fainter.</p>

<p>Martin tried to speak to her, but his mouth was dry.
He lifted his arms and held on to the rail of the bed,
trying to pull away from the searing. Then it overcame
him. He rolled and pretended to fight, but in his brain
there was only an exultant shouting.</p>

<p>As Deane knelt at the foot of the bed she looked down
at Martin and thought of the White Peacock; of the Gargoyle;
and of their relation to this man; and she felt the
lustful brooding of this trilogy which was dominant in
her life. Her breasts rubbed against the fine hair of his
knees and each touch made her wilder. Pulling at him,
she crawled up beside him, her fingernails scratching
the sheets. Then, from her throat came a strange cry, a
small cry, like the wail of a new-born child.</p>

<p class="tb">The snow kept piling against the windshield. Once,
Roberts had to get out and wipe it off from the outside.
As he stepped back into the car his foot slipped on something.
Deane’s violets! He flung them into the snow. In
his imagination he saw Martin and Deane together—saw
her laughingly repeat their conversation of the afternoon.
He visualized Martin’s shrug, and contemptuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
remarks. Roberts’ cheeks burned in the dark and he
drove more recklessly. At this very moment the woman
was probably in Martin’s arms.... Martin, with his
sultry gray eyes and tanned face. Martin, outlined like
a flame before him.... Roberts breathed the cold
wind and spoke aloud. “He deserves nothing but my
hatred. If I could make him suffer as he has made me
suffer! His picture before me always!—superior, contemptuous
and desirable! The night he sat with me in
my apartment, fresh from the sea—wind and salt in his
eyes and hair, I thought I had found life. My happiness
stretched into the horizon of his understanding. Solemn
and patient, he spoke to me and laughed with me. Now,
he speaks of me, and laughs <em>at</em> me—with her! I can hear
him laughing—” Roberts voice rose more fiercely. “He
is saying, ‘What?—tried to hold your hand? What the
devil would he want with that?’” The irritating, superior
tones rang in Roberts’ imagination. “Yes, I can hear
them: ‘Poor old Roberts—what a pity—chap must lead
an awful life—imagine going around with that handicap—not
that there’s any moral application, just a matter
of convenience—continually frustrated.’” Roberts
pounded the steering wheel with his fist. “The cattle!”
he whispered hoarsely. “As if they could understand—as
if <em>anyone</em> could understand. Damn them—their laughter
and their insufferable attitude! Damn their happiness....
Drink it, Roberts!—That I should measure my life
in terms of one night! One night with Martin, with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
young face and old eyes. With his laughter and his understanding.
What agony to be born one night and die
the same! Better not to be born at all.... Why, Martin,
did you swagger through the door with your flapping
dungarees and proud head?... Angels dancing in
the eyes that hold only devils now. Such insolence! A
bright, beautiful distillation of evil. Martin—the god of
selfishness, salt to the desire. A blinding picture that
grows with absence. A dust that burns the eyes and
chokes the appetite.... Delete the image!—step upon
it, crush it only to see it rise anew, more beautiful and
vicious than before.” Hot tears distorted Roberts’ vision.
He drew his hand across his face angrily. In a flashing,
intolerable whiteness, he saw himself swinging on the
tapestry of his heritage. “God!” he cried into the night.
“Predestination—crucified in the womb!” The image
grew more hateful in his mind. The cold wind dried his
tears. Slowly his mouth narrowed into a fanatical line.
“He has made me suffer. Moving relentlessly, superficially,
over people and life—eating life and dripping
its tantalizing crumbs from an overstuffed mouth—ruthless
and immaculate, he has made me suffer.” Roberts’
face was white in the light from the windshield. White,
unsmiling and purposeful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XX</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin met few people; but there was an atmosphere
of tension everywhere he walked. It didn’t make
any difference what color their eyes were—blue or brown
or clay, there was action. Mostly it was antipathy engendered
by something the fulcrum of this hate could not
understand. Sometimes, however, it was love—a piercing,
shrill movement that fell, ageless and sexless, over
his shoulders.</p>

<p>He did well with his work at the printing plant and
was finally transferred to a night shift where he found,
to his relief, that the hours were shorter, thus giving
him precious moments that he could spend with Deane
or devote to the perfecting of his type design. He liked
also the quality of concentrated activity during these
working hours at the plant, occasioned in part by the
darkness which enveloped the building and grounds.
He had no contact with the men around him except at
coffeetime; and they, in turn, sensed an indivisible chasm
where their thoughts and his whirled in confusion above
them.</p>

<p>Once, during the evening, a machine squirted. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
operator, swearing loudly, kicked back his chair and
was picking the lead from his trousers when Martin
glanced up, a phrase from the copy still in his mind.
He went to the man at once to help him; but the molten
metal, already hardened into splinters, had entered the
fleshy part of the operator’s leg, and the man, in considerable
discomfort, nodded his thanks to Martin and still
swearing, softly now to himself, limped out of the room
and down the hall.</p>

<p>It was two o’clock in the morning and time for the
men to knock off. In the awkward blue light Martin
wiped a smear of oil from his cheek. The mirror was
so distorted and the light so penetrating that his face
seemed one sided and all the lines about his mouth and
eyes were pulling in the wrong directions. He washed
his hands and face, glanced again into the crazy mirror,
buttoned his pea-jacket and headed for his room in
Greenwich Village.</p>

<p>His street was in a dimly lighted section made up of
rooming houses occupied chiefly by small tradesmen.
He had walked several blocks before he stopped to light
a cigarette. It was very quiet and through the shabby
elms the night seemed beautiful and lonely. As he
started on he heard someone behind him. From the sound
of the step, it was a woman. Vaguely, he wondered about
her; but he walked on briskly, enjoying this brief, cold
freedom, then stopped again, looking with interest
straight overhead at the same stars he had watched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
move in different latitudes and from different ships. For
the second time he heard the steps behind him and turned
round. At this, they broke off sharply, but not before
Martin had caught a distinctive note in them. They had
a giddy pitch that was not purely feminine. His curiosity
was aroused. He started down the street once more, walking
slowly now, with a precise, even stride. Then he
stopped abruptly. The feet behind him tapped on for a
second, fluttered, hesitated and stopped again. Suddenly,
in Martin’s mind, the unmusical gait gathered motif,
meaning and form. He remembered a repulsively ardent
smile.... “Carol!” he shouted. There was no answer.
Again he tried. “Hi! Carol!” This time his follower ran
quickly toward him.</p>

<p>“How did you know it was me, Martin?” asked the
boy excitedly, all smiles.</p>

<p>Martin, chameleon-like, studied the dregs of his memory
for similar situations or, he thought grimly, singular
opportunities; for this was not an element to be faced,
but one to be absorbed.</p>

<p>“We all have our characteristics, Carol,” he answered
evenly.</p>

<p>“Do you like mine, Martin?” Carol’s plaintive tone
softened the eager, beseeching import of his question.</p>

<p>Again Martin hesitated. He well knew that the middle
path was not as the Romans had worked it out—a smooth
highway, without deviation. He knew that the middle
path must fluctuate with both extremes to deserve the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
term—which in this case, he observed to himself further
with a certain cynical amusement, was between a
bitch and a son-of-a-bitch. He took hold of the young
man’s arm and spoke to him in a friendly fashion.</p>

<p>“Let’s go on up to my place, Carol,” he said.</p>

<p>On the dark stairs Carol followed close at his heels.
Martin could feel little tugs at his coat as the young man
hung on to him in a sort of childish panic and Martin
had a distinct impression that Carol was groping for his
hand. He could feel the boy’s breath on the back of his
neck as they continued to climb; and when they reached
the dark landing just outside Martin’s room, Carol was
still hanging on to him feverishly. Martin fumbled for
the keyhole, succeeded in finding it at last, opened the
door and turned on a dim light. Carol followed him into
the room, sighed with relief and closed the door quickly
behind them.</p>

<p>He stood there, just inside, his hand still on the doorknob,
gazing around him with wide eyes and obviously
taking notes. There was a pallet on the floor in one corner,
an old couch across from it and a writing desk in the
center of the room. He could see a T-square, erasers and
jumbled pieces of paper on the desk beside a miniature
of Deane. He turned his head away suddenly at sight
of the picture. In another corner of the room was a washbowl
with a screen half around it. There was a general
air of carelessness about the place which apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
made him nervous. Martin could see him straightening
up things in his mind.</p>

<p>“It’s really more comfortable than it looks, Carol,”
he said, trying to put his guest more at ease. “They
keep the rooms warm and that bed sleeps better than it
appears.” He unbuttoned his pea-jacket and hung it on
a nail on the wall. “Take off your coat, Carol, won’t
you?—and tell me what it’s all about. Two o’clock’s an
odd time to go creeping after people. Why didn’t you
call out?”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you wouldn’t like it,” answered the boy,
biting his lip. He removed his thickly woven plaid overcoat,
looked for a moment at the nail where Martin’s
jacket hung, then folded his own coat meticulously, gave
it a final pat and placed it with the utmost care over the
back of the rocker.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, when it’s handled that way,” said
Martin, keeping his voice smooth. “I prefer a ‘hello.’”</p>

<p>Carol spoke softly.</p>

<p>“I had to follow you. Deane told me where you
worked.”</p>

<p>“You asked her?” For the first time, Martin was
genuinely annoyed.</p>

<p>Carol smiled unhappily.</p>

<p>“I had to, Martin. I think you’re wonderful.” His
round face was ruddy and glowing and his eyes, bright
and intent, were fixed on his host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

<p>“Sit down, Carol.” Martin opened the window, pulled
his own chair from under the desk and sat down facing
him. “That’s strange,” he went on, a bit puzzled. “I
thought you disliked me.” He brushed back his hair
where the cold wind had rumpled it and sat quietly,
staring out the window into the darkness.</p>

<p>Carol shuffled uneasily.</p>

<p>“I did at first. You were mean. I nearly hated you.”
He sat forward, well on the edge of his chair. “But I
don’t now. I’m different now.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Martin, shaking his head quite
seriously. “You’ll feel the same at the last as you did
at the first. I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>“I won’t change, dear Martin. I think you’re God,”
the boy answered solemnly.</p>

<p>Martin nodded. Through the insufficient light within
the room, the bronze tints of his skin deepened.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am,” he said.</p>

<p>“Please don’t joke,” said Carol. His voice had acquired
a pathetic, pleading quality. “I mean you really
are—to me.” He shifted his position so that he could
not see Deane’s picture.</p>

<p>“She won’t bite,” said Martin bluntly.</p>

<p>Carol twisted his hands.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see it my way a little bit, Martin?” The
boy spoke now with a definite urgency, his words forming
an aggressive prayer. “Can’t you change <em>some</em>?”</p>

<p>“No,” Martin answered. “I can’t see the advantage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“<em>I</em> know the advantage,” said Carol softly. “I wish
you’d try and change just a little bit.” He hesitated, his
eyes shining. “I can’t tell you—but I could teach you,
Martin.”</p>

<p>“How did this begin, Carol?”</p>

<p>The boy gave him a fond, acquisitive glance.</p>

<p>“It began that afternoon at Deane’s. You took my part.
And then, at the drag, you were so beautiful in your
yellow gown that I fell in love right away. How did you
do your hair? It was perfect!”</p>

<p>“Damned if I know,” said Martin. He stared out the
window again.</p>

<p>Carol lowered his head, pouting.</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t fixed the same way after you came down
with Drew.”</p>

<p>“No?” asked Martin absently.</p>

<p>“No,” said Carol. “It was pinned different.”</p>

<p>Martin smiled.</p>

<p>“Are you sure,” he asked, “that it wasn’t Drew about
whom you were concerned?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Carol, flushing, “I never felt that way
about Drew. I just <em>love</em> to talk with him and be a pal;
but I never felt about him—like this—” His lips
trembled a little. “Maybe I was a little flirty—he’s
been so sweet to me; but then I’ve been that way before,
and I’ve never been in love. It was all puppy stuff
before.”</p>

<p>Martin slumped down in his chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve changed quite a bit in my opinions about things
too, Carol,” he said. “But it hasn’t boiled over and I
don’t believe it ever will. You know, Carol, that I love
Deane.”</p>

<p>The boy leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know lots of boys that like girls,” he replied,
nodding his head wisely. “But they like boys, too.” With
a timid gesture he reached out and touched Martin’s
hand. The back of Martin’s scalp tingled and he felt like
shivering; but he did not move.</p>

<p>“It’s no go, Carol,” he said, with finality. “It damned
well gives me the creeps.”</p>

<p>Carol leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“God,” he said, “I wish you’d try.” He bent forward
again, making no attempt to restrain his sorrowful
desire.</p>

<p>Martin jumped up, a kind of dull horror building
into rage. He took Carol roughly by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“God damn you! What’s wrong with you? What the
hell’s wrong with all of you? Don’t you like the feel of a
woman’s breast? Don’t you like a mouth that’s soft and
sweet, instead of a god-damned beard?” He noticed that
he was shaking Carol and stopped. He moved back a
pace, his face shaded, the perspiration pouring from
his brow in streams. “Do you think it’s smart to be this
way? Do you think it’s clever?” He closed his fists. “Give
me Eve, god damn you! Give me Eve, and take your
Adam!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>Carol was weeping softly.</p>

<p>“God,” he said. “I don’t think it’s smart.... Oh,
Martin, I’m so lonely. I can’t help how I feel....
Don’t be mad.... I won’t do anything....
Please—” He was rocking back and forth in his helpless
grief.</p>

<p>Martin sat down again. His face, which had hardened
in the previous moment, lost its straight lines and
the color came back to his cheeks. He ran his hand,
which was trembling slightly, across his eyes. He sat very
straight and stiff.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Carol,” he declared sincerely. “I lost my
head. I understand.”</p>

<p>But Carol cried out, his palms against his temples,
“You understand? <em>You?</em> You don’t understand at all....
The days! The long, wet days!—I can’t stand them
alone again!... You don’t know how I was born. How
I was raised. My mother died when I was born—Oh!
I’d have loved her.... My father took me to a mining
camp. There weren’t any women. Even the cook was a
man. They played with me, and gave me money....
After my father died, there were more men.... It’s
my first thought, and my last.... I wish you <em>did</em>
understand. Then you’d just <em>have</em> to love me.”</p>

<p>And Martin looked at Carol, at the tears running
down his cheeks, at the pain that locked his face into the
unknown agonies. He looked at the desk, at the picture
of Deane and back again at Carol. And to himself he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
repeatedly, “What good is compassion now!—What good
is compassion now!”</p>

<p>Strangely, he went to Carol, a dark line between his
eyes, although there was no frown except one for himself.
For a moment he stood facing the boy so steadily
and patiently that Carol wet his lips in nervousness,
waiting in a kind of stolid anticipation for whatever was
to come. Slowly, but with no hesitation, and still regarding
the boy with an indefinable expression, Martin raised
his hand and laid it on the other’s with such feeling, yet
such weight that Carol stepped away and bent his knee
as though he had been struck. Then, unresistant to Martin’s
comprehensive look—a look so full of search, and
surely pain, and perhaps knowing—and calmed by a
hand that had found kindness in its power, Carol stepped
forward again and held himself as though he were
bemused—for so he was, with all his innocence and
limitations conflicting with desire. And all the hopeless
libido went out of him before this other one who was so
straight and quiet and held him like—Carol thought,
and thought again—like—and then quite swiftly it was
revealed to him; like one man holds another. This chemical
transmutation within him was so rapid that even
Martin failed to see it. Just the same, as Carol, firmly
gripped by Martin in equality, knew himself another
man, he lifted his shoulders, stiffened in his new pride
as he beheld new vistas; and in an immediate beauty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
smiled, unknowing that he had left Martin, who dropped
his hand, bewildered.</p>

<p>Martin helped the boy on with his coat.</p>

<p>“Carol,” he said, his arm around him, “I want you to
know that I’m your friend.” Impulsively he went to his
desk and searched through a drawer. He drew out a snapshot
and handed it to Carol. “Here I am,” he said,
“climbing a king post at the beginning of a bad day.” It
was a plain little picture of a ship at a crazy tilt with the
sea, and Martin hanging tightly as he worked with a
lashing; but Carol put it carefully in his pocket and
smiled happily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXI</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The days were getting warmer. Rio stopped by Martin’s
house in the early afternoon and together they
walked to the Battery where they sat down on a bench
out of the sun. People were pouring in and out of the
Aquarium. Boats leaving for Bedloe’s Island whistled
and grunted against the docks. Liberty herself, as statuesque
as ever, shone from her spring cleaning and seemed
to hold her torch still higher and more independently.</p>

<p>Turning away from the water, Rio glanced at Martin’s
hand, his attention called to it, perhaps, by a ray of sunlight
which fell slantingly upon a flat block of black
onyx with a point of ruby in one corner which Martin
wore upon his middle finger.</p>

<p>“I’ve always wanted to ask you about that funny ring
you got there,” said Rio, yawning. “Where’d you find
it?”</p>

<p>Martin twisted the ring until it caught the sun more
evenly before he spoke.</p>

<p>“In the Red Sea,” he finally replied.</p>

<p>“Sounds like somethin’ back of it,” persisted Rio.</p>

<p>“There is.” Martin locked his hands around one knee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
and leaned forward in an attitude of tenseness. “The
year before I met you, Rio, I got hurt on the old <i>Silver
Cross</i>. She’s being scrapped now, and this was when she
made her last trip to the East. I was pretty bad in the
Indian Ocean, and the weather didn’t help any. I was
worse at Aden; and they had to take me off at Massaua.
When I was getting well I met a fellow named Nahrinja
who was agent for a man who owned a pearl-fishing fleet.
I wanted to get out on one of the boats to see how the
boys went about it. So when I was better he gave me a
knock-down to one of the Arab skippers and we set out.</p>

<p>“The Sudanese divers all seemed to like me, for I took
to their native lute as though I’d played it all my life. In
a few days I could do their ancient chants on the tamboura—somehow,
understanding this sad, lost music.
One Sudanese in particular, a boy named Sali, used to
squat silently on the deck and watch me by the hour.</p>

<p>“We were after the finest pearl—the bilbil. And one
morning Sali and I launched his dugout and piled in,
the natives laughing a good deal, for I wasn’t used to
their tipsy little pirogues. I paddled, while Sali looked
through a glass-bottomed box for a good spot. When he
found it, he went over the side with a weight to a depth of
forty or fifty feet, while I watched through the box to
see if he was all right and kept a lookout for shark. I
had tried it once, myself, in shallower water and had got
nicely stung by a poison fish for my efforts. Sali had
many such scars and seemed used to it. But he told me to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
be careful of the giant clams, careful of the coral and
particularly leery of the whip-tail ray, which can give
you a bad cut with their barb.</p>

<p>“Sali worked more than he should; but he brought
back good oyster. I was having a hell of a good time in
spite of the stinks, and looked like one of the divers with
my loincloth and my skin crusted with salt. Then it happened.”
Martin looked at his ring again and continued.</p>

<p>“Sali had just left the ocean bed when I saw a black
fin circle the bow of the boat. From his back, the shark
was a big one. I began smacking the water with an iron
pole, trying to frighten him away or attract his attention
to the other side of the dugout, and to warn Sali, who was
coming up fast.</p>

<p>“But just as the boy hit the surface, the shark struck
him and Sali’s head went under. I jumped over the side
and got him by the hair. When I brought him above
water and could see his face, it looked as though it were
frozen. He didn’t say anything or make any effort, and
I couldn’t get him in the canoe; but when I clamped his
hand on the gunwhale he held to it like a child, and I
climbed into the boat by the stern, hoping the beast
wouldn’t come back till I’d pulled the lad in. Finally,
I got him by the wrist and managed to haul him in without
capsizing. He looked down at his body at the place
where his leg had been, for it was off high up next the
hip. Then he looked at me and smiled, while two big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
tears ran down his cheeks.” Martin stopped again and
choked. “I hope, Rio, it was because he was shocked out
of his wits. I stripped off my loincloth and tried, as only
a desperate man can do, to get a tourniquet around a
place where I didn’t even have a stub to work on. At last,
I started to shove my fist up the hole where the blood
was spurting; and then, realizing that I was going mad
myself, I grabbed a paddle and headed for the mother-boat
like a demon. A pretty picture, eh, Rio?” said
Martin bitterly. “A naked white man, as bloody by this
time as the Sudanese, racing through the Red Sea with
a dying boy who thought I could make him live—for that
was what he kept saying all the time.”</p>

<p>“Cut it,” said Rio, his face hard. “Did you get him to
the boat alive?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Martin. “The nakhuda and another
Arab hoisted him aboard and we laid him on the deck,
out of the sun, with his head propped up. There were
only minutes left, with nothing to do but magic; so I
rubbed his wrists and whispered the Lord’s Prayer to
him. It sounded all right on that blistering deck, or must
have done so, for Sali kept smiling and repeating the
words—the sound of the words after me.... ‘Our
Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.’ ...
Then his face changed—I saw it coming. He spoke
thinly to the nakhuda, who knelt down and cut the string
around the boy’s neck which held this amulet.” Martin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
pointed to the charm on his finger. “Sali took it, and
with that hopeless, sweet trust glazed on his eyes forever,
held it out to me that death-like second before death.”</p>

<p>Martin cleared his throat and looked down at the grass.</p>

<p>After watching him for a moment Rio said quietly,
“That’s the last time I’ll ever ask about a ring. I done it
once before, and I ought to know better.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>Rio took his time, and scanned the harbor before he
spoke.</p>

<p>“I shipped out of Liverpool,” he said at last, “because
I had to once, on a vessel bound for the Solomon Islands.
My watch partner looked like a Limey, but he was a
shanty Irishman from Philadelphia. I never could quite
make ’im out. We had two hours in Lisbon on the trip
South, and he give a kid two bits American to get off a
spittoon in a Portugee gin mill. He told me it made him
nervous, seein’ a boy sit like that. Well, we had some
sour wine and some biscuits before I seen his ring. It
was a wide gold band on his left middle finger, and
somehow I asked him about it. He grinned and looked
pretty sick; but he said it was for Maud. I took another
drink and lit up a cigarette because I couldn’t see no
woman with <em>him</em>. He called himself ‘Philadelphia Dick,’
but the city would’ve killed ’im for it, since he was the
ugliest bastard I ever seen, with a skin like tripe and a
red eyelid that hung down like a lantern over his left eye.
He knowed I didn’t believe that Maud stuff, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
damned eyelid dropped down like he was laughin’ at me,
while he chewed on a biscuit with the ring wigglin’ all
the time under his Harp nose.</p>

<p>“We sailed, soon after, for undetermined cargo on the
Solomon’s. Every man of us got fed up after we got
there, for it was ‘lay to, and wait for orders.’ We had the
ship so clean she ached, and finally we got shore-leave.
The second engineer hammered me out a barb and Chips
fixed an ironwood shaft for me, so I had a good harpoon
to try on the bass and some red trout I seen around
there. Philadelphia Dick grinned and looked sick again
when he heard I was goin’ fishin’; but he and a couple
of other sailors come along.</p>

<p>“It was a small atoll I picked near the mainland; so
we rolled up our pants and waded to the belt of coral to
have a look at the lagoon. The water was still; but all
the fish I could see was small for my spear. One of the
boys though, who was standin’ between me and Dick,
slapped me on the arm and reached quick for the harpoon;
and then I could see the water break a ways out,
and a turtle come up from the shallows. It was a big
one—about three hundred pounds—and we all got down
on our knees and stayed quiet, except Philadelphia Dick.
He stood there with his jaw droppin’ and his skin turnin’
so red that his loose eyelid hung down, limp and white,
like a blossom.</p>

<p>“The turtle waded up pretty slow, takin’ its own
damned way like they always do, till the guy that had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
my spear seen it was time. He jumped up and run toward
the creature, raisin’ his arm to let the turtle have it
through the eye. But he never made it,” Rio added
slowly. “Philadelphia Dick hit him in the cheek and then
in the nose, which broke so we could all hear it snap—even
the damned turtle, who crawled on up like nothin’
had happened. Well, we stood there like a bunch of god-damned
fools, like the guy who’d been clipped, while the
turtle come on till she stood right in front of Philadelphia
Dick. By God!—they watched each other till it
made us feel in the way somehow, and we got the hell
out of there. Once, the guy with the bloody face turned
round and looked back at Dick and the turtle. ‘She took
his eye, Rio,’ he said to me, funny-like. And I said, ‘Yeah—that’s
Maud.’ ‘Maud?’ he said, still lookin’ funny, and
we went back to the ship.</p>

<p>“Philadelphia Dick didn’t come back that night; but
a native brought ’im alongside the next mornin’ and he
come up the Jacob’s ladder like a snake. The Chinee
cook seen ’im first and turned green. For Dick’s eyelid
was down to his cheek like it had been sewed there, and
his good eye was too cold for a man. But the worst thing
was the look of his Irish nose that had been tilted up for
thirty-five years—till then—but that had bent overnight
into a hook as sharp as the creature’s we was all thinkin’
of. By the mercy of God, we sailed that evenin’ for
Sarawak. Philadelphia Dick was at the steam winch when
I seen ’im last; but five minutes later nobody could find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
’im on the ship. When we got to Borneo the Devil himself
must’ve reversed our sailing orders; for we was sent
back to the Solomons, though the sailors hadn’t no
stomach for it, I can tell you. The galley boy, more
scared than silly, said somethin’ about Maud, and got
the back of the hand from one of the men. Most of us,
though, took this jinx along with the bugs and the sour
bread; but we was all steppin’ like the Chief’s cat when
we hove to about the place where Philadelphia Dick had
jumped ship. We was all by the rail expectin’ somethin’,
and we got it. A couple of turtles drifted in about midships
and out of the long green we watched two beaks
come up. One was Maud, the other a stranger. The god-damned
Chinee cook yelled out and pointed. I seen the
fella—a wide blue turtle with a heavy, forward shell.
He scratched Maud (who looked pretty wise) with his
right flipper and lifted the other one at us. The damned
Chinee yelled again and we seen why; for there was a
gold band like a barrel hoop, high up on that blue
turtle’s port leg, where no human hand could’ve put it.”
Rio stopped.</p>

<p>“And then?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“And then a film come over that fella’s left eye and
dropped down like our shipmate’s—and sure enough,
there was Philadelphia Dick, hatin’ our guts, but tickled;
and with all of us lookin’ on and wonderin’, he winked
at us again and sounded, with his arm under Maud’s
belly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>Rio cleared his throat and looked out at the water.
For a few minutes, the two men remained quiet until Rio,
glancing at Martin, saw that his friend was hunched
forward, his head down, still staring at the grass, and
that his eyes were wet.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Martin,” he said.</p>

<p>Martin put his hand under his chin and regarded the
other with a look so brief and yet so haunting that Rio
held his tongue.</p>

<p>A Green Circle ship was leaving the harbor. The word
<span class="allsmcap">NOMAD</span> was painted on her bow.</p>

<p>“I made a trip on her one time,” said Rio, pointing,
and changing the subject deliberately. “Old Hungry was
the steward. God! What food!”</p>

<p>Martin straightened up and leaned back against the
hard, wooden bench.</p>

<p>“I never saw you when you couldn’t eat,” he said,
smiling a little.</p>

<p>“This wasn’t no different,” replied Rio, grinning with
satisfaction. “I got chummy with the galley boy and
lived handsome. I ate the Old Man’s oranges and drank
the chief engineer’s ale.”</p>

<p>Martin looked amused.</p>

<p>“Did the kid supply you with romance, too?” he asked.</p>

<p>Rio regarded him strangely.</p>

<p>“No,” he stated, after a moment, “but that brings
somethin’ to mind. Maybe you know the answer, my
educated friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Martin, in a dry tone.</p>

<p>Rio shifted his position, moving back out of the sun.</p>

<p>“I was in Santa de Marina last trip, as you know,” he
said. “There was a girl, and a boy.” He stopped talking
abruptly and removed his cap long enough to wipe away
the perspiration which had gathered on the band. “By
God, I can’t finish it!” he added vehemently.</p>

<p>Martin was silent.</p>

<p>Rio thought for a moment, then sighed and went on.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s hard tellin’. There was somethin’ funny
about the girl. Funny in a nice way. And she was screwy,
too.” He wrinkled up his nose. “She made me dance
pretty, but I could see she wasn’t tryin’ to.”</p>

<p>“In the Street of Curtains?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“Yeah. But she don’t belong there,” said Rio, his
voice rising. “I don’t believe I’ll leave her there.”</p>

<p>“That sounds just right,” observed his friend.</p>

<p>“You ain’t heard the story,” said Rio quietly.</p>

<p>“That’s right. The boy?”</p>

<p>Rio shook his head.</p>

<p>“He’s tougher to figure than his sister.”</p>

<p>Martin glanced up, interested for the first time.</p>

<p>“His sister was the girl?”</p>

<p>“His sister was the girl,” repeated Rio. “The boy—well—I
never knowed no kid like him—” He stopped
and stared at his friend. “Unless——”</p>

<p>“Unless it was myself, Rio?” supplied Martin, a hard
smile on his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<p>“Since you’ve said it—yeah.” Rio looked out at the
harbor again. “I give the girl all the money I had, and
went back to the ship with the boy. On the way, there
was a tree in flower—” He turned sharply on Martin
and took hold of his shoulder. “Say,” he said in a low,
intense voice, “what the hell’s wrong with me, Martin?
By God, I want the truth!”</p>

<p>Martin could see astonishment and resentment in Rio’s
face; also a desperate sense of fear.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything wrong with you, Rio,” he said
calmly. “I’ve been afraid, too. And I’ve been sick with
anger at the extremes. But if God Almighty granted you
one precious moment, as I believe He did, and you didn’t
spend it, you can get down on your damned knees with
the rest of the dilettantes and say your A B C’s to Heaven
the rest of your life without getting another.” Martin’s
face was now so flushed with an anger he could not
understand that it was as dark as Rio’s.</p>

<p>The frown had left Rio’s face. Infinitely puzzled, yet
reassured, he stared at his friend.</p>

<p>“You can still talk, can’t you, Martin? You can still
make me believe you. Yeah, even when you lie, you
make me feel better.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Martin, “I can still talk. For I have a
problem myself. Perhaps you can help me with it.”</p>

<p>“Shoot,” said Rio, relief in his voice.</p>

<p>“It’s about Carol. I’ll try to make it quick for I know
you don’t like him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span></p>

<p>“D’you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that. Here’s the point. Things are
getting a little mixed up in our fashionable set. Drew
kept down the friction, but he went away and I can’t say
that I blame him.”</p>

<p>Rio grinned.</p>

<p>“He didn’t cut down the friction on me,” he said, patting
his back and grimacing. “But I’m not sore at him.”
Rio laughed out loud. “He’s too damned pretty. Anyway,
what about Carol?”</p>

<p>Martin leaned over and spoke confidentially.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you now, but I saw it,” he said, in a low
voice. “Carol’s bound for it,” he went on moodily.
“What a shame!”</p>

<p>Rio swung around to stare at his friend. His own
mouth was open, and his soft brown eyes were as wide,
as honest and as startled as those of a besieged mare.</p>

<p>“I’ll be god-damned!” he whispered, and turned away
from Martin to stare out to sea. He stuck out his tongue
and pulled at his ears. Then, after a moment, he settled
back on the bench and regarded Martin with a worried
expression. The sun disappeared behind a sailboat and
in the bay, Liberty grew darker. A salt wind came up
from the harbor and the shadow of the Aquarium now
covered all that section of the Battery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>It was uncomfortably warm in the room where Martin
was working on his type. He tried it awhile longer,
then put aside his papers and went to the roof.</p>

<p>There were two women lying on a blanket taking a
sun bath. They were in bathing suits and had the straps
pulled down over their shoulders. Martin had to pass
them to get to the opposite side of the porch. So he excused
himself and only glanced at them briefly. But his
presence apparently irritated them. One of the women,
dark-haired and older than the other, seemed particularly
annoyed. She laid her hand on the younger girl’s
arm and whispered something audibly and caustically to
her friend. The remark was in such bad taste that Martin
turned around and surveyed them coolly.</p>

<p>A dog was lying on the blanket with the women. He
was little and white. He was young and curious and
friendly. He trotted over to Martin, observed his white
slacks, then looked back at his own coat. He sniffed at
the slacks and raised his head, and all the while, Martin
stood quietly and looked at him. The dog’s eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
brown. His legs were sturdy. Martin wanted to put his
hand on the little head. He had done it before with
animals. It was a sort of blessing. He wanted to say, “I
like you. Don’t let yourself be destroyed by these people.”
But he did not move. The women would object.
They would speak sharply and the puppy would be
ashamed.</p>

<p>Blood filled Martin’s head. He had worked late the
night before and he was tired. Anger shook his mind.
Once more he looked across the roof at the women.
Then he knelt to the dog. Holding the nervous head between
his hands he watched the brown eyes. In his own
was reflected an heroic poem—an attainable star. Martin
did not beg nor did he demand. He showed the small
one something greater than pettings and soft food. He
showed him hard winds, ice and sun; his wolf-like ancestors—their
smoky, torn fur. The dog became quiet,
watching intently. He made no sound.</p>

<p>Martin held him patiently, listening with him to the
soft pad of feet on the leaves above and around them.
The dog’s brown eyes grew wider, older, and became
lost....</p>

<p>Martin stood up and regarded the women, thinking,
“Symbols of a denatured civilization! Men linked together
are strung, it is true, on the rock of a fool’s evolution.
But in them tragedy, strength and beauty neutralize
the distortion—while across from me, on the roof,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
grope the clowns, the mimics, playing music they
can never understand. The chords they touch turn
black....”</p>

<p>The older woman called the dog to her. She put her
arm around him and called him “Willie.” It was not the
word. It was her eyes, and her mouth, and the way her
hands worked. “It is an indictment of womanhood,”
thought Martin. The woman looked at him; and seeing
him stand so cold and full of hatred, she held the dog
tighter. She held his fur and his body tighter; but Willie
had gone. He was standing by a campfire. His hair was
singed and there was a red line across his shoulders.
His eyes were tired and glad with dreams.</p>

<p>Every woman feels biological change. It is her first
lesson and her last. Although she often misinterprets her
intuitive strength, she possesses it. This woman looked at
Willie. She could not smell the singed hair nor see the
red line; but she did see his eyes. A sadness, a real sorrow
was in her. She turned from the dog to Martin who
stood contemptuous and erect, and she turned away.</p>

<p>“Now am I right,” Martin asked himself, observing in
spite of his anger this dark woman’s passion, “to condemn
the ovary that cries out for its sister?—and absolve
by ritual the formulated counterpart in man?” He
stood there, pondering in this procession of new thought.
“And am I wrong, that I can’t feel the love that topples
ethics, puts wire in soft fingers with one breath!...
Why can’t I feel the music of one breast upon another?
And why do I call such music ‘black,’ when I might taste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
much softer lips than mine upon much softer lips?...
These dismal cries—two sheer stockings ripped from
their garters and one frightened voice saying, ‘God!
Make it straight with me!’—while the other, frantically
tries syntheses and fluctuating pose....” Martin
watched the slender clouds beyond the black roofs for a
moment, then went below.</p>

<p class="tb">Martin was drowsing on the couch in his room when
there was a rap at the door which he had left open. He
glanced up sleepily. Roberts was standing there, an attempted
smile only accentuating his moroseness.</p>

<p>“Come on in,” said Martin cordially, sitting up. “Have
a chair. That one’s the most comfortable.” He pointed to
the rocker.</p>

<p>“Damn comfort,” replied Roberts, nevertheless sitting
down. He was thinner. There was an harassed expression
on his face which Martin had never seen before. “I
dare say you’re surprised at my coming here,” he continued.</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin, frankly good-humored. “And I’m
glad to see you.”</p>

<p>The adviser waved the words away.</p>

<p>“Don’t be social, in heaven’s name. It isn’t in your
make-up. And if <em>you’re</em> not surprised, I am, considering
the attitude you’ve taken toward me lately.”</p>

<p>Martin laughed, stood up and stretched and offered
him a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a damned grouch, Roberts. You never got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
an attitude you didn’t ask for. Light up, and I’ll show
you some work I’m doing. It’s too hot to fight.”</p>

<p>“Stop talking like a hussy,” said the adviser as he
took the cigarette. His face was damp and his hand was
shaking.</p>

<p>Martin half-closed his eyes and there was a curious
line about his mouth. Then he laughed again and held
out a lighted match.</p>

<p>“What’s so amusing?” asked Roberts, holding his
hand against his cheeks which seemed to be burning. “Is
it this squalor you’re living in, or is it I? You’re steeped
in sin, Martin; but this is the first time I’ve felt the flatness
of hypocrisy.” There lay his mistake. He’d struck
a heel softer than he knew. For with every flaw Martin
had, he hated the word just spoken the most. His entire
appearance changed and his cheeks became as white as
Roberts’ were red.</p>

<p>“Are you here as a friend?” he asked.</p>

<p>The changed timbre of Martin’s voice seemed to stabilize
Roberts.</p>

<p>“As a friend.” The adviser was serious. “I have something
that should interest you vitally.” He regarded
Martin, who still seemed unresponsive. “Don’t underestimate
this,” Roberts continued severely. “I happen to
know that Carol is following you.” He waited intently
for the effect of this speech upon his listener.</p>

<p>“I suspected as much,” answered Martin. “In fact, I
found him at it one night and asked him up.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Roberts, shocked, amazed, with every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
thread of jealousy burning in his face. “Good God,
Martin! The man’s dangerous. I know him better than
you do. He’s pathological. He’ll stop at nothing. And you
permitted him—you saw him here, alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Martin dryly. “All, all alone.”</p>

<p>Roberts stood up, propped his stick in a corner and
walked the length of the room. His head was lowered; he
was absorbed as if debating with himself. At last, he
turned swiftly.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to die, do you?” he asked, staring.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then watch out.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“For that kind of impudence which incurs my displeasure.”</p>

<p>Martin leaned back against the head of the couch, put
his chin on his hands and looked solemnly at his visitor.</p>

<p>“Have you lost your mind?” he asked.</p>

<p>Roberts’ mouth opened and shut as though he were in
rarefied air. Then he sat down again and looked at his
hand which was still shaking.</p>

<p>“Martin,” he whispered, “I’m frightened.”</p>

<p>“I’m not astonished at that.” Martin sat up. “Roberts!”
he cried earnestly. “It’s imperative that you get your
thoughts out of this channel!”</p>

<p>“There <em>is</em> no other channel,” interrupted the adviser.
“I’m humiliated, degraded—but there is no other channel.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Martin. “I won’t try to persuade you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
to think differently then. But I do ask you to give me the
real purpose of this call.”</p>

<p>“I came to warn you.”</p>

<p>“Against Carol, or yourself?”</p>

<p>Roberts did not answer. His face was set and all the
color had drained out of it.</p>

<p>Martin observed him closely.</p>

<p>“You’ve had some bad nights, my friend.”</p>

<p>The adviser wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>“Yes. Bad nights. That I should live—for this!” He
looked about him wildly.</p>

<p>Martin sat up straighter.</p>

<p>“Overlook the This, my mad companion, and look for
That!”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Roberts stared at him with amazement rising to horror.</p>

<p>“Destroyer of words!” he said. “My God! You destroyer
of sand and clay and rock that make the brilliant
hills!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Destroyer.” Martin nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Roberts got up, holding unsteadily to the arm of the
chair.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you to your destiny!” he cried with savage
vehemence.</p>

<p>“Unless it’s interwoven,” answered Martin coldly.</p>

<p>The adviser’s eyes grew bright as though with fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<p>“Again, your hatred in your words.”</p>

<p>Martin nodded once more.</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“What will you do if I don’t permit you——” Roberts
stopped.</p>

<p>“Propose something,” commanded Martin, rising.</p>

<p>“I do.” The adviser picked up his stick and walked
uncertainly toward the door. As he turned, he seemed to
be smiling. “I <em>have</em> proposed something.”</p>

<p>With an easy stride Martin went to him. He took the
stick from his hand and placed it against the wall. He
reached for the door and closed it. Deliberately, he
caught Roberts by the waist and bent him backwards
until he fell. Then he poured one bitter kiss after another—his
teeth cutting the adviser’s tender lips and
cheeks, his sweat falling like molecules of light.</p>

<p>Roberts screamed and turned his face away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXIII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>One quiet evening Deane and Martin walked down
to a street Exhibit in the Village. Since Roberts’ visit to
Martin, Deane had felt a melancholy restlessness about
the man she loved; and on this evening, with small stationary
clouds in the west prolonging the summer twilight,
she tried with careful intrigue to bring him back
again.</p>

<p>They walked the long way—past odd, forsaken streets;
past streets with checkered, foreign signs; past junk
shops, curio shops; past streets where old furniture, silverware
and books were on display within the dusty,
ill-kept windows; past lending libraries; past a little half-street
with quiet, mysterious houses; past streets that
wandered helplessly about until, faced with some busy
thoroughfare, they paused abruptly, bewildered, and of
necessity came to their end. There was one street built
like a dagger, with a single row of trees across it for its
hilt. There were crooked streets, dirty streets, smart
streets; streets attempting to be gay and failing miserably;
streets falling over themselves; scrambled streets;
streets running pell-mell at last into Greenwich Square.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span></p>

<p>The Exhibit centered around Eighth Street and meandered,
after various aimless shambles, along MacDougal
Street and into the somewhat limited security of MacDougal
Alley. Countless easels which held oils or studies
in crayon, finished or unfinished, were scattered about
the sidewalks. Odd bits of craftsmanship hung on the
walls of buildings or were placed for sale on the curbs.
Caricaturists and cut-out artists in their batik smocks
were hawking their talents to the crowd, not with the
loud, raucous voices of sideshow barkers at a fair, but
with proud and careful gestures, and an occasional remark
about art in general which most of the crowd took
seriously.</p>

<p>At the end of MacDougal Alley a hard, slim man who
looked like Popeye was daubing wildly at his canvas.
Martin grinned and pulled Deane back by her elbow,
stopping her suddenly.</p>

<p>“Look at that old boy,” he said under his breath, all
his melancholy abstraction leaving him in an instant.
“He’s mad as a hatter, and dreaming of a Dutch ship he
took one time out of Sumatra. See, honey?” Martin grew
more excited and pointed to the painting. “She’s built
like a sabot—equally stable in the North Sea or the
South Pacific. The Hollanders knew how!” He nodded
wisely. “By God! I have a little of their blood in my own
veins,” he continued with pride. “The painting’s bad.
But the thing’s there, all right. The man has memories.”
He jigged Deane’s arm again. “I’m going to tell the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
chap I’m a steamship man. Watch him blow up. <em>He</em> never
sailed under anything but canvas.”</p>

<p>Deane grew concerned.</p>

<p>“Don’t make him angry, Martin,” she said, holding
back.</p>

<p>“I won’t. Come on, darling,” and pulling her after
him, he walked up casually behind the old seaman.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Martin, as though speaking to Deane,
“<em>there’s</em> a fine ship!”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t know her stem from her stern,” said the
painter, turning round to observe the speaker, then dabbing
a ferocious spot of sea under his ship’s bow.</p>

<p>“She’s beautiful,” insisted Martin. “That is—she
would be, if she had just a touch of steam.” He paused
for a second. “There’s nothing like steam in a calm, or
if you need a head in the wind.”</p>

<p>The brush dropped out of the painter’s hand and his
face turned the color of brick.</p>

<p>“Steam!” he snorted. “<em>I</em> went round the Horn with just
me hat spread, boy!” He picked up his brush, wiped it
carefully and jabbed at the canvas again. “I took me
own ship round the Cape durin’ a gale! There was less
time than you’ll get in your liner—and it gave me a belly
at fifty <em>you’ll</em> never see at thirty!”</p>

<p>Martin nodded.</p>

<p>“Canvas had its points, all right,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“Steam!” repeated the old master scornfully, not in
the least mollified, and spat upon the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” persisted Martin, “I wish I could have tried
your square-riggers. I never quite trusted steam, myself.”
His voice sounded a little regretful.</p>

<p>The old master looked at him, suspicion in his eyes.
Suddenly he stepped nearer and brought his face up
close to Martin’s.</p>

<p>“Do ye know where the Scylla Deeps be?” he asked
mysteriously.</p>

<p>“A sea no sailor has found, sir,” answered Martin.</p>

<p>The old master continued to peer at him with mistrust.</p>

<p>“Where did me best rope hang, boy?”</p>

<p>“From the yardarm, sir.” Martin gave him a slow
smile. “And it’s not all that hung from there, sir,” he
added, knowingly.</p>

<p>The master’s face turned into a series of amused lines
and crevices. He grabbed Martin’s arm and his white
lips puckered into laughter.</p>

<p>“If I could’ve had ye as cabin boy, me lad, ye might’ve
made a sailor!—But no more steamship gab!” he warned,
shaking his finger. He turned once more to the painting.
“Now ain’t she a beauty?” He pointed with pride to the
ship and over his ravaged face came a sorrowful and
faraway expression. “She was trim as a herring,” he
said, so low they could scarcely hear. “Trim as a herring,
me boy.”</p>

<p>Martin spoke soberly, with an infinite respect.</p>

<p>“She was, sir. And she is. I’m glad you’re bringing
her alive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span></p>

<p>The old master stared at him. His eyes seemed flaked
with salt and he brushed one rough hand across them.</p>

<p>Martin took Deane’s arm once more.</p>

<p>“Good-by, sir. A good trip, sir,” he said, pulling
Deane along. But the old master just kept staring as the
two walked away.</p>

<p>“Why did he look like that?” Deane whispered, her
own eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>“That ship went down, honey—and the master, also,”
answered Martin.</p>

<p>On the next corner, standing in an erect, unnatural
posture, was a man with a full red beard. In one hand
the man held a comb which occasionally he used on his
chin with a gesture at once contemptuous and desperate.
In the other hand there was a ragged paper upon which
something was written—and this, he wore as though it
were a part of him. When any passed too close he would
draw back the manuscript, hastily covering the words, the
beer stains and perhaps tears with his palm. His bold
chin under its red blanket would jut angrily; he would
hunch his shoulders, and his eyes, which were a little
blurred, would narrow in agony and hatred. Martin,
ashamed for all mankind that it had shamed this artist
and his work, walked by with an impassive glance, understanding
full well the torment of beauty which must be
held within itself. But the man, sensing some kinship
within Martin, or feeling some belligerent contempt, held
out to him the sheaf of paper containing all the golden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
words born of himself in adoration, hunger and distrust.
His speech was rapid, barely articulate.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five cents, <em>sir</em>?” he called out mockingly. “A
block of my heart for twenty-five cents!”</p>

<p>Deane pressed against Martin and he knew that she
was frightened. He tried, without speaking, to tell her not
to be, and walked on with a strolling deliberation, eyes
ahead without expression, minimizing as far as possible
the high chain of laughter behind them. He visualized
the rotten teeth—the long hysteria——</p>

<p>And then they came upon a flower man, a small Sicilian
with an olive skin and a charming, wistful face. He was
standing by his little cart, his hands down by his side as
though in a mild passion with his lot among the flowers.
There were cornflowers and mignonette; crisp French
marigolds and early cosmos. Deane made her choice.</p>

<p>“Buy me the marigolds,” she asked of Martin. “You
remember?—they were your first gift to me.”</p>

<p>The little olive gentleman bowed and smiled; and
carefully selecting the freshest marigolds from his stock,
twisted a strip of tinfoil around their stems before handing
them to Deane.</p>

<p>Shortly after they left him, Deane looked back. He
was standing by his little cart, still smiling, his hands
down by his side in gentle obsequiousness.</p>

<p>Touched deeply by this profound and infinite patience,
Deane thought of all the things she had seen that day—one
man with a phantom ship, one with a poem, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
one—She glanced sideways at Martin, and suddenly,
unnoticed by him, the tiny bunch of marigolds which she
was clutching fell from her grasp....</p>

<p>Later, in the soft candlelight within the apartment,
Martin sat on the arm of Deane’s chair, quietly twisting
the ring upon his finger. The small red stone on its field
of black looked at him speculatively. The tender perception
which had been Deane’s all that evening now gave
way to a definite and fearful prescience.</p>

<p>“What is it, darling?” she asked, for Martin had not
spoken in some time.</p>

<p>“I love you,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“I love you, too. But what disturbs you, Martin?”</p>

<p>He avoided her eyes.</p>

<p>“It was only a dream,” he said at last. “But it has
worried me. I dreamt I died and found myself at the
crossroads of Heaven and Hell—there to make my decision
as to which path I should walk.”</p>

<p>“What? A dream—worry you?” Deane sighed with
relief and ran her hand across his cheek. Then she arose
and led him to the divan. One by one the candles had
gone out and like a specter, the pallid light of the full
summer moon crept into the apartment. “Go on, my
darling,” she whispered, half closing her eyes and
stretching luxuriously against him.</p>

<p>“I died,” he repeated. “And I found myself at the
crossroads of Heaven and Hell. I was undecided as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
which road to take. Then suddenly I knew the answer.
I knew they diverged only for a time.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” In Deane’s voice was a note of
dismay.</p>

<p>“I knew that whichever road I took, it would end in
pain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew that the end would be the same; so,
impudently, I took the road marked <span class="allsmcap">HEAVEN</span>. I walked
for days among winding mountain paths. Giant trees
sang to me in the wind, and the air was fragrant with
pine and wild rose. Little creeks ran past me, twisting
over mossy rocks; and there were narrow falls of water
spinning white and silver. In shadowy places where the
water eddied dark green and gold, I stopped to rest and
drink. A long time I walked through this country. By
day, the sun struck blindly through the limbs of trees;
and at night, a moon showed. Then I came to a valley
where I saw broad fields of grain, shining yellow, and
checkerboards of green pasture and plowed field. I was
confused by the intermittent sound of bells which rang
through the air.</p>

<p>“On one block of green pasture there was a great
multitude. I went down the trail, leaving the forest behind,
and descended into the lowland. As I approached
the congregation, I saw to my amazement that they were
all children. I wondered at their quietness. They were so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
silent and unmoving that I would have thought them dead
had it not been that they were facing me, a sweet, desperate
expression on their faces. The macabre quality in
these little ones gave me an unpleasant thrill. No murmur
sounded from this congress of children—no movement
of arm, knee or head.</p>

<p>“Full of a presentiment of evil, I walked closer and
looked down into their eyes. Row after row of these
spectral organisms were before me, reaching, it seemed,
to the horizon. Thousands of bright, curly heads shone
faintly in the haze of the sun. Their wide eyes, blue or
brown, were directed at me.</p>

<p>“My mouth was hot. I tried to smile.</p>

<p>“‘Have I reached Heaven?’ I asked them.</p>

<p>“The answer seemed to be projected from a thousand
throats, but it reached my ears as a whisper. This tired
wind, blowing so, held only compassion. It was unbearable.
And it said—‘We love you.’”</p>

<p>Martin’s face became severe and rigid as he told this.</p>

<p>“Go on, Martin,” Deane urged.</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“It was a dream, Martin. Finish the dream.”</p>

<p>“It was destiny!” he cried. “I murdered ten thousand
innocents! I asked them if I was in Heaven, and
they answered that they loved me. To wheedle, to coax a
smile into their weakening, passive faces, I asked a question....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span></p>

<p>“They told me that they loved me,” Martin repeated
tiredly, and once more, Deane felt a prescience of terror.</p>

<p>“I wanted to raise my hand,” Martin went on. “I
wanted to shout, to jump into the air, to sing a song—anything
to dissipate the irrevocable impression of death
that carved each face into the appearance of a dying
flower.</p>

<p>“I was desperate and I felt that I was wrong.</p>

<p>“‘Children,’ I said, ‘I have hurt you. Tell me the
poison, the action, or the mood that has brought you this
pain.’</p>

<p>“I can’t explain how they looked. It wasn’t sadness,
nor was it condemnation. It was a death’s joke and I was
horrified. Again the wind of their minds moved restlessly
in my ears.</p>

<p>“‘Pain you prophesied,’ it said.</p>

<p>“‘It was a prophecy of pain for myself,’ I told them.
‘I didn’t mean to condemn you.’</p>

<p>“This time,” said Martin, “there was no answer; no
audible answer. But for the first time the children moved,
dropping gently on their knees. They lowered their eyelids,
accentuating the pallor of their faces.</p>

<p>“I cried out to them. I begged their forgiveness. I
cursed myself, tore open my shirt and looked for a
weapon, reasoning that my death would bring life to the
children.”</p>

<p>As Martin said this, he caught his breath and projected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
a swift pain into the woman. Deane held him
gladly—drawing in his venom—half fainting.</p>

<p>But Martin, pressing deeper into his mind, continued
furiously.</p>

<p>“At each of my gestures—at each syllable, the children
sank closer to the grass. Their eyes closed with
precision until only the fringe of lash showed where the
eyes had been. Watching this slow death of thousands, I
stopped speaking and stood rigid, my jaws locked. I
glared at them. I saw each movement become fainter
until each tortured flower-face lay on the ground, their
chins propped up to me. Their cheeks were like wilted
petals, their white, reedy arms were extended above
them, and each child-finger was pointed toward me.”</p>

<p>Martin stopped speaking. Deane lay quiet within his
arms. She felt his face against her throat, felt her own
arms pinioned and her agony intensified. Compassionately
she kissed the thick perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXIV</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin pushed his chair away from the linotype,
waiting for copy. He leaned back and spoke to Rio who
was sitting on the windowsill behind him.</p>

<p>“Smell that sulphur?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“It’s from the plant across the way. Gets sweet about
this time every night. You’ve probably noticed it before.”</p>

<p>“It don’t make no difference,” said Rio. “This is one
hell of a place any way you look at it. Noise and dirt.”
He spat out the window.</p>

<p>Martin yawned and stretched in his chair, but made
no answer.</p>

<p>“It ain’t no place for me,” continued Rio grimly.
“Some of the boys look restless. Is it the strike you’re
worryin’ about?”</p>

<p>“The strike may not come off, Rio. There’s always a
lot of talk. And if it does, it’s no worse than the waterfront.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, I’m goin’ out for a smoke.” Rio
walked into the little hallway, calling back over the banisters
to Martin to find out how much longer he had to
wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span></p>

<p>Martin glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“I’ll be through in twenty minutes,” he said. “We can
stop down the street for a nightcap.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be outside,” Rio mumbled, and went on down
the stairs.</p>

<p>He was sitting on the steps when Martin joined him.
His huge frame filled the doorway and as he arose lazily,
Martin wondered, as he had wondered many times
before, at the harmony of his movements.</p>

<p>Far beyond the reaches of the sulphur fumes, the soft
tread of these men, accustomed as they were to the intricate,
woven fabric of the sea, made scarcely a sound
in the night.</p>

<p>Rio sniffed.</p>

<p>“New York,” he said, as they walked along. “It smells
different this time of year.”</p>

<p>And Martin, through his friend, felt a definite, new
motion in the color of the air—a deliberate music
brought by the full season. In both retrospect and in the
moment, Martin watched Huysmans, that frightened
older brother, break the skyline into small patches of
dim lights between the darkened buildings.</p>

<p>So still was the atmosphere that the two friends felt
annoyed at the sight of a lighted tavern. But they stopped
in for a drink nevertheless, then went on slowly toward
Martin’s rooming house.</p>

<p>“Say, Martin,” said Rio finally. “I been thinkin’ over
that act you pulled with Roberts. I don’t get it.” He
laughed. “It’s funny, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p>“It really wasn’t an act,” replied Martin.</p>

<p>Rio looked at him through the darkness.</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, no!” interrupted Martin. “I’ll admit, it’s
difficult to understand—even for me. But the way he
stood, the way he smiled, and his new threat (remember,
he’s carried them out before!) made me break loose. I
kept thinking, as I looked at him, that he’d always asked
me for something that he didn’t want. When I called him,
I must have known he wasn’t real. For when I pretended
a consummation he was frightened and ashamed.”</p>

<p>Rio shook his head.</p>

<p>“You’re a brave lad. It makes me sick to think about
it.”</p>

<p>Martin’s tone was peculiar.</p>

<p>“I was poisonous,” he said.</p>

<p>Rio looked at him again and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it cured him.”</p>

<p>Martin thought a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose that when it comes down to it
I don’t understand him at all.... By the way, Rio,
what made him take such a dislike to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ much. I asked him about you once and when
I found out he lied, I shook him up.” Rio closed his fist
in the dark. “I wish I’d shook ’im harder now,” he added,
half under his breath.</p>

<p>“Damn it! That’s the pay-off!” said Martin angrily.</p>

<p>Rio turned to him.</p>

<p>“If you mean you’re fed up messin’ with this queer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
outfit, I’m with you.” He began to walk more rapidly. “I
wish to God I was back——”</p>

<p>Martin interrupted.</p>

<p>“I know. Sometimes I wish we were at sea again.”</p>

<p>“What about Deane?” asked Rio.</p>

<p>Martin’s voice was as even as his steps.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mention her name, Rio,” he said. “We
never think about a little thing like that the first time.”
His voice was trembling now. “But I wouldn’t ever see
her, or mention her name again.”</p>

<p>They walked along Eighth Street without speaking for
a few blocks until Rio turned to his friend.</p>

<p>“Is that all you’re goin’ to say?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m a miserable bastard, Martin. I wish I was in
Santa de Marina. By God!—I think I’ll go.”</p>

<p>Rio sounded so unusually plaintive that Martin had
to laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you. Why don’t you return to the
family? Your money won’t last them forever and you
could make out all right down there.”</p>

<p>They had reached Washington Square and were about
to turn down Martin’s street when Rio stopped him.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in and sit down for awhile, buddy. There’s
a few things I’d like to ask you.”</p>

<p>Martin walked beside him until they came to the large
circular rim of the fountain. They sat down on the low
concrete wall and Rio put out his cigarette, grinding it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
under his heel on the pavement. It seemed difficult for
him to speak.</p>

<p>“Y’know,” he said, finally, “I been around more than
most men. I been places and seen funny practices, and
ugly ones, among the heathen. And I know Berlin better’n
I do New York. The same goes for a few other cities. I
thought I’d scraped most people and most happenin’s.
Then I had the luck of bumpin’ into you.”</p>

<p>“Good, or bad?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“Bad, I guess, or I’d have missed it.”</p>

<p>“Why bad?”</p>

<p>“Well, because I had a few ideas that I believed in.
Somehow, you’ve managed to mess ’em up.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Martin, emphasizing his words
with a quick movement of his hand. “If you were on a
weak foundation you shouldn’t mind having your opinions
reversed. If you had a strong one I couldn’t change
it.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t one or the other,” said Rio in disgust. “You
can take an idea, right or wrong, and squeeze it like
butter.” His tone grew deeper and Martin felt that he
was frowning in the semi-darkness. “I’m goin’ to ask
you a question, Martin. Don’t get sore; and I don’t mean
it hard. But I got to know. We’ve kidded each other a lot
since we met. You stood by me—” Rio’s voice faltered.
He swallowed and stopped for a moment. Martin could
hear his heavy breathing.</p>

<p>“Get rid of it, Rio,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<p>“It’s god-damned crazy,” said Rio, swearing to hide
his embarrassment. “But listen, Martin. Are you——”</p>

<p>Martin half closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he thought. He watched his friend struggling
through this viscous medium in a painful attempt to
absorb most of its ugliness himself. But he gave the man
no clue, no help. He merely closed his eyes tighter and
listened.</p>

<p>“Are you—” continued Rio. Then, his voice stronger
and more demanding, “Are you a god-damned fairy with
your god-damned eyes and the way you look at people?
You looked queer in that draggy dress at the party, and
you acted queer.” Rio hesitated. “Oh, I know you took
care of me afterward. But when I seen you leanin’ on the
piano like a girl, I went crazy. If you’re a queen, tell
me!” His voice had become so husky that he could
scarcely speak. “And if you ain’t—what are you? Let
me know. Let me know damned fast!” He was breathing
still harder and Martin could hear his hands rubbing
against the concrete.</p>

<p>He slipped off the side of the fountain and faced Rio.
In the quiet night, without a moon, the open stars drew
their icy shine across his eyes. He lit a cigarette and in
the brief flare, Rio could see the drawn lips, the contemptuous
silhouette and the sharp lines in his face.</p>

<p>“Time doesn’t count, Rio. Kindly don’t be in a hurry.”
Martin spoke softly. “And remember, I’m talking about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
myself and not you, so don’t be anxious. You’ve asked
me a question in your manner, and I’ll answer it in your
manner, Rio. I am.”</p>

<p>“Damn you, you’re not!” Rio cried out.</p>

<p>“Then it’s for you to judge.”</p>

<p>“I don’t judge nothin’, Martin,” said Rio, standing
and facing him. “But if you ain’t, why d’you hang
around them?”</p>

<p>“‘Them’?” asked Martin, with a bleak smile. “If you
could see yourself standing there, frightened of yourself,
frightened of me, frightened of symbols——”</p>

<p>“I tell you, I’m not like that!” interrupted Rio, his
hands back of him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are,” said Martin quietly.</p>

<p>“Clear that up.” Rio was leaning slightly forward in
dignified, yet dangerously immobile restraint. “Clear
that up fast.”</p>

<p>Martin spoke earnestly, without resentment.</p>

<p>“Before you ever ask another man that question, Rio,
go to the mirror and ask it of yourself. Perhaps the
answer will be—‘thou, too’!”</p>

<p>Rio kept the same tense attitude.</p>

<p>“You mean <em>I</em> am?” he asked slowly. “You better explain
it well this time. Show me your point.”</p>

<p>Martin looked at him indifferently.</p>

<p>“You asked me, didn’t you, if I was queer; and although
you’re deathly afraid of it yourself, you hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
such people in contempt. Did you think I was going to
deny it as though it were intrinsically a shameful
thing?”</p>

<p>“You say it ain’t shameful?” said Rio, not changing
his position.</p>

<p>“It exists,” went on Martin calmly. “It’s part of life.
It has its particular and its important position in the
world. It has its stages and its stratas. Thus it is, Rio—this
force was created.”</p>

<p>“Created for what?” demanded Rio. “For nightmares?”
He wiped away the sweat from his forehead.</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin. “Created for balance.”</p>

<p>“‘Balance,’ hell!—those upside down bastards?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say they were balanced. I don’t know that,
because I don’t know where the average begins or ends.
I said they were created for balance. A necessary people
forming a resilient salient between the rigidity of the
sexes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” said Rio heavily.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother, then,” said Martin. “And don’t make
an issue of it. I’ve looked at Carol and seen the reason,
the essential purpose of his destiny.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Rio.</p>

<p>“And I’ve looked at Drew,” Martin continued. “He
made me wonder what the word ‘normal’ meant.”</p>

<p>“God, you’re crazy,” whispered Rio.</p>

<p>“I’ve looked at Roberts,” confessed Martin, “until his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
helpless, sick desire forced me into desperation, and I
tasted the germ of his too bright mouth.”</p>

<p>“God!” repeated Rio, horrified.</p>

<p>“And I’ve looked at you,” went on Martin.</p>

<p>“Yeah?” breathed Rio, straining forward.</p>

<p>“And I became less blind.”</p>

<p>Rio’s heavy shoe scraped the pavement.</p>

<p>“And I’ve looked at myself,” said Martin, lifting his
voice. And still more firmly, “I’ve looked at all of us
and found us all so different—and yet so much the
same.”</p>

<p>“Holy Christ,” said Rio softly.</p>

<p>“Aye,” Martin nodded. “Holy Christ.”</p>

<p>They left the park and walked on silently, each thinking
more of the other’s thoughts than of his own. A wind
from the south, carrying a burned, sulphurous cloud,
quickly hid the stars and descended until even the solitary
street lamps were darkened, became ominous and
were worse than none at all. It muffled the occasional
sounds of late night and was as forbidding as the attitude
of these two silent men; for except themselves, the
streets were deserted, and their presence only accentuated
the desolation. It was a moment of such stillness
that even nature becomes disturbed and ultimately furious,
and sharply moving her wing, brings down a sudden
and a violent sound.</p>

<p>A block away from Martin’s room an ambulance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
rushed past them, its siren full and piercing. It drew up
quickly before the house and an ambulance doctor with
white cap and trousers bent over a man who was lying
on the curb. A thin group of spectators had gathered.
They were quiet, looking on curiously. Martin’s landlady
was standing by, shivering and crying. Martin went
to her and touched her arm.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mrs. O’Brien?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mr. Devaud,” sobbed the woman. “I
heard a noise. I guess it was a shot. So I looked out the
window and there he was.”</p>

<p>Martin hurried back to Rio.</p>

<p>“What does it look like?” he asked nervously. “I can’t
see.”</p>

<p>Rio struck a match.</p>

<p>“I dunno. He can’t get no pulse.”</p>

<p>The doctor was still kneeling between them and the
figure. At last, he moved to one side and opened the
man’s shirt, throwing a point of light on a small, discolored
spot under the heart. The man’s face was in
bas-relief. But above the wound, in a broken curve, lay a
delicate, golden necklace....</p>

<p>Martin leaned over swiftly and started to speak; but
Rio stepped in front of him.</p>

<p>“The guy’s dead, eh, Doc?” he asked solicitously,
glaring at Martin all the while over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Get back,” said the doctor brusquely, to the crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
Then he called out to the driver. “Come on, Jim. Lend a
hand.”</p>

<p>Rio took Martin by the arm and they walked up the
steps quickly.</p>

<p>“You god-damned fool,” Rio kept whispering to him.
“You god-damned fool. Keep your god-damned mouth
shut.”</p>

<p>In Martin’s room they sat down and faced each other.
Rio continued to swear at him.</p>

<p>“So there you are,” he said mockingly. “Carol’s
knocked off and you want to butt in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for Christ’s sake, shut up!” said Martin miserably.
Then seeing the expression on Rio’s face, he went
over to him and put his hand on his shoulder. “I didn’t
mean that, Rio. I know well enough you saved me a lot
of trouble out there. I’m just trying to figure it out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so dumb,” said Rio, and put his cap on
backwards.</p>

<p>“Yes. It must have been Roberts. I suppose that’s
what he meant when he said he had proposed something.
I knew it. I was slow. Damn him. Why?”</p>

<p>“Why not? Carol was in his way,” said Rio philosophically.</p>

<p>Martin stood up.</p>

<p>“Rio!” He spoke swiftly. His voice was harsh and a
terrible light burned in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” Rio answered calmly. “He won’t hurt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
Deane to-night. He’s weak, some ways. This one job’s
enough for his stomach this time. He’s in bed—cracked
up. Puking his guts out. But later, I dunno.” Rio was
growing thoughtful.</p>

<p>“How did he get away with this, Rio?”</p>

<p>“He’s a clever son-of-a-bitch.”</p>

<p>“Clever?” repeated Martin. “I wonder.” He moved
toward the door. “Rio, I’m going to see him.”</p>

<p>Rio went to his friend and held his arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t stick your chin out, Martin,” he said earnestly.
“Maybe I got an idea myself.” He righted his cap, and
without further explanation left the room.</p>

<p>Martin pulled up the rocker in front of his small radio
which he turned on softly. There, his head in his hands,
he sat and rocked until morning. Then he took a train
uptown to Deane’s.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXV</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Roberts woke up with a sticky feeling in his
mouth. He felt his wrist. It was still throbbing. With
difficulty he repressed a sudden panic brought about by
his full consciousness of this last and most horrible link
forged in the confused entries of his life. He got up, put
his feet in a pair of slippers and went to the mirror. He
stuck out his tongue and looked at it carefully. Walking
away, he stopped suddenly and glanced over his shoulder
at himself. Then he rang for his breakfast and went
into the bathroom.</p>

<p>Although he was accustomed to this pale Orient, an
atmosphere of mauve with the suggestion of a darker
tone enhanced by lights, direct and indirect, it seemed to
stimulate him now as though it were a new experience.
He took a crystal flagon from its glass shelf and shook
the bottle slightly, watching the opalescent liquid as
hungrily as though he were going to drink it. Removing
the stopper, he closed his eyes and drew in a deep breath,
shivering; and as an afterthought, carefully shook two
drops upon his fingers and rubbed them into his temples.
The astonishing scent filled the bathroom and Roberts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
leaned against the wall as the odor of stable frost arose
about him. Slowly, he removed his pajamas, white as his
skin, and let them fall around his feet. The warm water
from the shower sprayed off his head. He stuck out his
tongue again and swallowed a little of the water. It
tasted salty and he spat out what was left. After a careless
shave he put on a dressing gown of deep red corded
silk, and staring vacantly, sat down in front of the coffee
table in his living room.</p>

<p>The boy knocked and entered with his breakfast.</p>

<p>“My paper?” Roberts looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It’s on your tray, sir,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“That’s right, my lad. Always a paper with one’s
eggs.” The adviser laughed sententiously.</p>

<p>The boy put down the tray.</p>

<p>“Will that be all, sir?”</p>

<p>Roberts looked up again, severely.</p>

<p>“Is that all? Most certainly. Do I ever digress from
this routine?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the boy and left.</p>

<p>Roberts mused, his lips spasmodically making little
ticking sounds.</p>

<p>“Is that all? What else could he want? The scamp—he
acted as if he knew something. A pretty lot <em>he</em> could
know—or anybody, for that matter.” The adviser looked
around the room, smiling shrewdly. There was a single
scarlet geranium on his tray. He picked it up with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
caress and held it briefly under his nose before he tore
off the petals. Then he looked at his eggs.</p>

<p>“Cold, as usual,” he said bitterly. “And what’s this?—a
spot?” He put his spoon into the eggs. “The nucleus,
no doubt. Good heavens!—does fertilization confront me
even in my breakfast?” He tried to control his anger and
nibbled at a piece of bacon and toast. The hot, black
coffee he drank greedily.</p>

<p>A short article at the bottom of the front page of his
paper attracted his attention. He read through it swiftly.
A murder in Greenwich Village. He smiled again, this
time his right eye winking slightly.</p>

<p>“Definitely a bad neighborhood, Mrs. Twitchett,” he
said amiably. “People who go down there must expect
such things, my dear.” Then, with a start, he brought
himself up. “You ass!” He spoke harshly to himself.
“You giggling, impossible hermaphrodite! Hush!” But
unable to repress his amusement he laughed aloud,
pressing his finger to his lips secretively. After awhile
he picked up the paper again. “What was the name?
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">... Carol?... Yes, Carol Stevens. A young chap,</span><br />
so the papers say. But he’ll be a long time down there.
It will bring maturity.... Unfortunately, he might be
connected with Martin Devaud? That would be scandalous.”
Before the smile reappeared on Roberts’ face
he looked at the article once more. Certainly, it would
not involve himself. Being merely decent to a homespun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
lad like that. There couldn’t be any connection there....
He spoke aloud again. “There isn’t any connection,
you bloated bunch of rags! You confounded, grayish
bunch of rags! This is the time of year to remain in
one’s own department.”</p>

<p>He went to the desk and took a sheet of paper. Meticulously
he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">To the Police:</p>

<p>Using a small caliber automatic and under the pretense
of friendship I approached and shot Carol
Stevens. The motive was jealousy.</p>

<p class="center">Signed:</p>

<p class="right">William Roberts.</p>

</div>

<p>He permitted a slight smile. Then, taking a box of
matches out of his pocket he struck one and lit a corner
of the paper. After the note had burned he dropped the
ashes into the wastebasket.</p>

<p>He took another piece of paper and wrote the same
message, stood up and looked at it from a distance, taking
his eyes away from it at intervals, for a second at a
time. Then he picked up the paper, and waving it around,
walked to the other end of the room. After a few moments
he walked back, humming, and slowly burned it,
too.</p>

<p>Again he wrote the message. This time he left the
room. A moment later his face appeared in the doorway.
It was tense as he walked rapidly to the desk. But when
he saw the message, undisturbed, he smiled again. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
picked it up, crumpled it into a ball and threw it across
the room. Leaping after it and retrieving it with a desperate,
sweeping motion, he unrolled it with quivering
fingers. Hastily he read the words and again the satisfied
smile lessened the tension on his face. Then he rolled
the paper once more and walked to the inside wall. He
stood with his back to the room for a long time, at last
throwing the wadded note as far over his shoulder as he
could, one hand covering his eyes. Turning around, he
looked on the floor. The paper was not there. He began
to walk back and forth swiftly, looking on the divan, on
the chairs. The message was not to be seen. Finally he
stopped in the center of the room, a curiously stupid
expression on his face. He felt slightly dizzy and the
room seemed to be turning. He walked hesitatingly to a
chair, his titubation increasing. Leaning over the chair,
he looked at the room from this angle. The paper had
apparently vanished. He felt his pulse and was alarmed
by its rapid beat. In an attitude of half-fear, half-anger,
he went hurriedly over the room again, lifting the pillows
from the divan and from the chairs. Then he went
to a mirror and looked at himself. The pupils of his eyes
were large and startling, set in a pale, grayish face lined
with anxiety. Panic-stricken, he ran to his clothescloset
and took down another dressing robe. This he hung over
the mirror in the living room. Animal-like, he fell to his
knees, and crawling around the floor, peered under the
fringe of the rug. His shoulder bumped against a chair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
and he tipped it over angrily. His movements became
more and more frenzied. At last each article had been
closely inspected, and still there was no message. He ran
to the door and locked it securely. Suddenly, he looked
at the window. It was open. He drew his hand across his
forehead which was covered with perspiration. His knees
trembled. He sat down abruptly, the upset furniture
swaying around him.</p>

<p>Within this desperate sense of fear he quickly regained
his balance. He went to the buffet and drank a
small brandy. Unsteadily, but seriously, he dressed. He
started to leave the room, hesitated, and as an afterthought
went to the window. He leaned out and looked
down at the alley-like space between the buildings. Unable
to distinguish anything, he closed the window, went
out into the hall and rang for the elevator.</p>

<p>Downstairs, he crossed the court, climbed over a low
fence and walked down the space under his window.
One crumpled white paper drew his attention, but it was
an empty cigarette package. Toward the sidewalk he saw
another wadded paper. People were passing close by
and he picked it up self-consciously, not daring to hope
that it was the one he wanted. Walking back to the court
he opened it feverishly. His eye caught the first line. It
said, “To the Police:—” He read no further, but jammed
the note hastily, though carefully, into his pocket and
folded his hand around it.</p>

<p>In his apartment, came the reaction. He lay on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
back on the upset divan, his hand still gripped around
the paper, and wept softly and bitterly. When he had
stopped shaking he went to the desk, smoothed out the
paper and read it, a definite horror on his face. Then
anger relieved his fear and he struck the note repeatedly
with his fist. Throwing it into the metal wastebasket, he
tossed burning matches after it until the confessional
was alight with flames. Methodically he straightened the
room and took the robe from the mirror. Looking into
the glass, he held out his hand and with amazing swiftness
struck the side of his face.</p>

<p>Later, in the bathroom, he saw with satisfaction the
purple outline of his fingers on his cheek.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXVI</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Deane answered the telephone nervously. A voice,
thin and unsteady, came over the wire.</p>

<p>“Deane? This is Roberts.”</p>

<p>With difficulty Deane restrained a sudden feeling of
panic.</p>

<p>The adviser spoke quickly, without waiting for her
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“This is rather unusual, but I assure you the situation
is imperative enough to justify its obvious lack of convention.”</p>

<p>Deane’s anxiety increased.</p>

<p>“What situation, Roberts?” she asked.</p>

<p>“A situation so delicate that its discussion by phone
is impossible. Won’t you do me the kindness to have
dinner with me?” Roberts’ voice had taken on a strange,
beseeching quality.</p>

<p>Thoroughly frightened by the implication of drama,
Deane tried to remember that she had once been attracted
by his intelligence, amused at his suavity. She
accepted his invitation.</p>

<p>What could he want of her? She was glad that Martin
had gone home. He would never let her meet Roberts if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
he knew. She recalled how frightfully upset Martin had
been that morning.</p>

<p>While she was dressing she kept wondering what urgency
had prompted the adviser to contact her so quickly
after the tragedy. Surely no guilty man would do such a
thing. Perhaps Martin and Rio were wrong. Perhaps
Roberts wanted to help.... Did he know about that
picture of Martin the police had found in Carol’s pocket?
Thank God, Martin had had an alibi. Or—did alibis really
count!... Poor Carol! Was she responsible for his
death? It was true that she had introduced him into this
ill-assorted group of men who, more experienced in the
conflicting currents of human emotion, could anticipate
and often avoid such danger. She remembered little
phrases and gestures of Carol which in retrospect seemed
touching and child-like. She remembered the day she had
gone to lunch with him—his earnest, immature face as
he reflected the thoughts and effusions of this man whom
she was meeting. What blindness of hers that she had not
foreseen an approximate outcome of this relationship!
Deane’s eyes were full of tears. She felt the tremendous
sorrow of the immaculate woman for the spikes and
chains which bind humanity’s certified incompetents.
Too, for herself, there were tears of indignation—resentment
over being drawn into this formidable unity. She
finished dressing and hurried uptown.</p>

<p class="tb">In the restaurant, Roberts leaned slightly forward,
over the table, his hands together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span></p>

<p>“Deane,” he said, “I didn’t ask you to meet me because
of Carol’s tragedy. The child was drawn into a
significantly dangerous vortex. But it is about this uncompromising
whirlpool itself, which may engulf others
whom I love, that I want to speak. There is something
here—some sinister thing about us that is in deadly
earnest. Do you sense it, Deane?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Roberts. Particularly now.”</p>

<p>“Martin,” continued the adviser, “does not appreciate
the undercurrent of this danger. It is for this reason—for
this one reason I begged you to see me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Deane repeated, feeling her skin tighten as it
does under a great and hopeless fear.</p>

<p>“I have but one thought in mind—” Roberts proceeded,
“Martin’s future. His temperament is one that
will not adjust itself to the inevitable.”</p>

<p>Deane’s hand closed over her bag. A swift feeling of
revulsion changed as quickly to one of anger.</p>

<p>“The inevitable?” she asked, controlling her voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Roberts. “The inevitable routine of this
world. I have it on good authority that he is about to lose
his job at Miller’s Typographical. You know his history.
He came to me a transient—a common seaman. I found
him a good job. I made contacts for him in this respect
which he used, or rather abused, with an amazing recklessness.
I do not understand his lack of appreciation.
But these things are unimportant. Regardless of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
inconsideration, I feel that there is definitely something
worth saving.”</p>

<p>“That’s good of you, Roberts,” said Deane, inclining
her head a little, the large hat shading her eyes. “Martin
would be pleased to know that you consider his regeneration
a possibility.”</p>

<p>Roberts’ lips tightened at her irony. His fingers moved
constantly over the white tablecloth, touching a cup—a
spoon——</p>

<p>“I appeal to you, Deane,” he said finally. “I recognize
your influence over him.”</p>

<p>She remained silent.</p>

<p>“Have you no answer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course not.” Deane’s moist, red lips closed tightly.</p>

<p>Roberts picked up a spoon and tapped it nervously on
the table.</p>

<p>“I have always respected your antagonism, Deane,
but I am somewhat unprepared, just now, to face a personal
issue. By coöperating with me, I feel that we can
bring about some satisfactory adjustment on the part of
Martin that will give him success and happiness.” The
adviser waited, quiet and intent.</p>

<p>Deane’s eyes paled, the color fading into clearness.
She looked at Roberts abstractedly. To her it seemed
that an unhealthy whiteness moved now under his skin.
His handsome face seemed trembling, disintegrating and
forming anew, misshapen under the pressure of his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
His cheeks appeared alive with white nerve roots, moving
uncertainly, like microscopic serpents. The lens of
Deane’s eyes penetrated through flesh into the dark
coils of blood, visualizing curiously the spiraling, pallid
germ.</p>

<p>Roberts jerked in his chair. He leaned sideways, holding
to the table. His cuff brushed a tumbler and a little
of the water spilled upon the cloth.</p>

<p>“Deane!” He spoke sharply. “What are you looking
at?”</p>

<p>Her eyes grew deeper, lost their transparency.</p>

<p>“I was wondering.”</p>

<p>Roberts’ voice trembled. His words were insecure.</p>

<p>“You were wondering.... You were wondering at
what? What are you looking at?”</p>

<p>Deane took her eyes from him.</p>

<p>“Please go on, Roberts.”</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>“I was saying—I was saying that you have a remarkable
influence over Martin. Doubtless he has told you of
our early misunderstanding—a misunderstanding based
on the assumption that I was instrumental in having
him fired. As an intelligent woman you are probably
aware of the fact that he lost his position because he
neglected his work. He is not incompetent, but his social
program affected his efficiency.”</p>

<p>Deane spoke without looking at him.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that I caused Martin to lose his position?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
Her lack of resentment, her cold, unemotional
question disconcerted the adviser momentarily.</p>

<p>“Indeed not,” he answered. “Please believe that I
have valued and approved his friendships for certain
people. Martin tends toward introspection and celibacy.
It is most important that he cultivate the social quality.
That is why I was so astonished that he should, of a
sudden, become so interested in what constitutes society.”</p>

<p>“I do not constitute society, Roberts. I love him.”</p>

<p>Roberts lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Deane,” he said anxiously, “I hope that you do not
believe that I have intended to invade your personal
affairs. I am concerned only with Martin’s development.
I truly desire his life to be a complete and happy one.”</p>

<p>“Then please tell me what you want.” Deane made an
uneasy little gesture.</p>

<p>For one lost moment, Roberts’ pallid cheeks were covered
as though by the light of a beautiful, dark flame
and he leaned across the table with a desperate, hopeless
lust.</p>

<p>“You know what I want, Deane. <em>You have always
known.</em>” Now, he was breathless and the color left his
face, leaving him whiter and more distraught than before.</p>

<p>Deane sat erect. There was more than anger in her
expression. There was the fury and the cruelty of all her
sex against what she believed to be the pitiful, crippled
shade of themselves—against the mist of a forever-damned
kinship which thought as woman thought, desired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
with woman’s desire, and still was mist, without
substance, without gratification. Deane’s voice was barely
audible.</p>

<p>“Never,” she whispered.</p>

<p>At her expression and her exclamation, Roberts wet
his lips and trembled slightly in his chair, gazing at her
as though in some enchantment.</p>

<p>“Never?” he asked, in a voice as low as her own, but
with the quality of a protesting and bewildered child.</p>

<p>“Roberts!” Deane spoke so sharply that he was shaken
from his spell and sat more normally, looking at her now
with quiet speculation. “What is it you wish me to do?
I see no reason to protract a conversation so unpleasant.”</p>

<p>The adviser met her glance with restraint.</p>

<p>“My motives are misconstrued,” he said slowly. “You
will forgive my naive desire to lend Martin my support?”</p>

<p>Again Deane’s eyes dimmed and faded. Catching his
own reflection, Roberts’ pallor grew even more death-like.
And again he gripped the table, his knuckles white
under the transparent skin. In the opalescent mirror of
the woman’s eyes he saw his image—saw the pale movement
within himself. Deane, her face cruel, drove her
thoughts in swift waves, building and clarifying the
image until the naked picture of the man and his disease
rose clearly in her mind. There was an odor of
decay. Roberts half rose from his chair, slipped back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
into it, and leaning sideways on the table stared fixedly
at her.</p>

<p>Terrified, she arose. In Roberts’ face there was no
blood, no expression. His eyes were set and the cords
of his throat made ridges in his white neck. Deane put
her hands over her eyes. She knew now. Her thoughts
raced.... “<i>He killed Carol. He wants to kill me!</i>” ...
Without excusing herself she left the restaurant
and hurried to a cab.</p>

<p class="tb">Roberts, his hands limp on the tablecloth, stared before
him. He felt Deane’s movement as she left, but he
remained as he was.</p>

<p>“Take your eyes, too!” he said aloud. His voice rose
higher. “I say, take your eyes!”</p>

<p>Other diners looked curiously at him, smiling and
nodding their heads. A small, dark woman exchanged
glances with her escort.</p>

<p>“He’s had plenty,” she said. “I watched him and the
woman. They had an argument. The man’s tight.”</p>

<p>Her escort regarded Roberts earnestly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It looks as though he has the horrors.”</p>

<p>Roberts gazed steadily at the translucent eyes floating
across the table.</p>

<p>“All right, my dear. Stay there,” he said loudly.</p>

<p>The dark woman’s escort glanced at him worriedly
and beckoned to a waiter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span></p>

<p>“Say, waiter, there’s a chap over there with the jitters.
He needs looking after.”</p>

<p>The waiter approached Roberts warily.</p>

<p>“Is there something you wish, sir?” he said, deferentially.</p>

<p>Roberts still watched the eyes. He stood up and spoke
quietly.</p>

<p>“Very well, I shall go. You remain here.” Turning to
the waiter, “My hat, quickly.”</p>

<p>Outside, the adviser hailed a taxi, climbed in unsteadily
and directed the driver to his apartment.</p>

<p>Dropping his coat on the divan in the living room, he
went hurriedly to the mirror and stared into it. The light
on the glass wavered, a shadow appeared, and Deane’s
eyes, large and transparent, materialized before him.
Roberts cried out sharply.</p>

<p>“I told you to stay!”</p>

<p>He jerked around, went to a chair, sat on the edge of
it and put his head in his hands, rocking gently on his
toes.</p>

<p>“My God, Martin!—to think that I could have loved
you! After all, Devaud, you’re nothing but a sailor. A
hostile, bestial—” Roberts’ head jerked back and he
jumped to his feet, breathing heavily. “Deane,” he
panted, “you’re in this room! It won’t help to try and
hide. I can locate you by your eyes. They’re in that glass
there.” He pointed. “You think you know my secret.
It’s a lie! It’s a dream, and you’re a lie!” He leaned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
against the chair, his cheeks darkening. “I’ll find Martin.
Martin will be fair.... Martin—you always liked
me. You didn’t deserve a job.... Take her away,
Martin! I want to sleep. I can’t sleep while she’s hiding
here.” He stopped speaking, a crafty expression changing
his face. Tiptoeing into the bathroom, he pulled the
mirror from the cabinet and holding it under his arm,
crept back to the living room.</p>

<p>Approaching the larger glass which hung at the end
of the room, he quickly drew the other mirror from under
his arm and held it so that the two of them reflected into
each other. Then, bursting into short, sobbing laughter,
he shook the smaller glass furiously.</p>

<p>“There! Look at yourself! You’re sick, too!” His
laughter became fiercer until his body rocked from its
violence. Suddenly he stiffened. The mirror dropped
from his hands, the glass splintering, and Roberts fell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXVII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin and Rio walked along the waterfront in
silence. All activity seemed suspended. It was a lonely
and a menacing panorama to both men who realized
that the very heart of the city had been pierced. Imported
goods and products for exportation were lying
quiet, slowing up the commerce of the world. Union
longshoremen and truckmen had walked out with the
striking seamen; and the desperate efforts of independent
groups could not compensate for the loss of regimentated
teamwork and good fellowship, so vital. Policemen
patrolled each pier to prevent acts of violence
between organized and unorganized Labor. Between the
entrances, the scattered trucks rolled about like confused
ants.</p>

<p>“Damn the governors!” said Rio, thrusting out his
jaw.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“<em>Who?</em>” repeated Rio, in exasperation. “Capital, you
bastard! Capital! <em>You’ve</em> eaten their sour pudding and
slept on their lousy blankets!—and you ask <em>me</em> ‘who’!
It’s Capital that smashes Labor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span></p>

<p>“Money and work,” said Martin serenely. “Money
and work.”</p>

<p>Rio turned on him nervously.</p>

<p>“Cut out that speakin’ in tongues, or whatever the hell
it is, Martin. I’ve heard you damn the Companies from
Shanghai to Port Said. Anyway, what about the printin’
plant?”</p>

<p>“It’s closed. The boys walked out. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“The same reason they’re walking out everywhere—for
better hours, better conditions.”</p>

<p>“When do they open?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There’ll be arbitration, of course. Most
of the men though, have put away enough chips to ride
it. I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Rio, “what are you goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that either. I have enough left to run
me for a few weeks. Then if things haven’t opened I’ll
have to ship out.”</p>

<p>“And leave Deane with Roberts around? You told me
not to mention her, but I guess it’s O.K. now.”</p>

<p>“Deane will be all right,” Martin nodded. “Roberts
had a stroke. He can’t move.”</p>

<p>“Roberts? A stroke?” Rio looked pleased, and there
was a definite satisfaction in his voice as he continued.
“Maybe that’s why my idea didn’t work. I went to his
place that night, and the next. The second time he was
home, but there was lights....” Rio shook his head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
wisely. “And I work in the dark,” he added, looking at
Martin. “But about the plant—can’t you get another job
ashore?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. I don’t know another trade.”</p>

<p>“Then what the hell good did college do you?”</p>

<p>“College? That’s another one I can’t answer,” said
Martin. “I was too young. The world turned backwards.
I hated my young, fresh hair and the child in my face.
I needed the forest and the open sea—an insane wind
that held my breath. I hated pedantry, and the inquisitive
eyes of girls.”</p>

<p>“What else?” asked Rio.</p>

<p>“It’s too old to hurt now,” answered Martin.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Rio.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t much. It taught me to drink incredibly bad
gin—corrosive enough that it’s a wonder I have any
guts left. Why go on?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Rio. “You had it your way, and I
had it mine. But it was all the same.... I had the
wind you longed for, and it put scissors in my throat!
Let’s forget it. Look!” He pointed to a wharf near them.
One group of men walking along it held signs in the
air. Another, grimly silent, stood by the entrance to the
warehouse pier, watching those who came out and those
who entered. “We’ll forget our trouble in <em>that</em> scramble,
Martin! It looks like our boys have tied up a ship.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see. That’s Pier V7. What ship’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span></p>

<p>“The <i>Leana</i>. She makes Pedro, and Puget Sound, I
think.”</p>

<p>One of the men who were carrying signs stopped when
he saw them.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Rio.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Brick. What’s the jibe?”</p>

<p>“They paid us off an’ are tryin’ to ship a fink crew,”
answered the man, hitching the sign a little higher. “We
dumped the mattresses over the side last night comin’
in. The bedbugs had made ’em Snug Harbor. I slept on
the hatch off the coast of Mexico. And God!—what
roaches!”</p>

<p>“Hmm,” said Rio, and he and Martin walked on.</p>

<p>They had started uptown when a man came out of the
warehouse. One of the union men who was watching
the doorway ran after him and knocked off his cap with
the flat of his hand. The other tried to fight back but
was smothered with punches before a policeman broke
it up.</p>

<p>“Like old times,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Let’s go up to the Hall,” suggested Rio.</p>

<p>They reached South Ferry, walked to Pearl Street and
went up the stairs into an old building. The room was
crowded with seamen. Some of them, in chairs tilted
against the wall, were sitting quietly or exchanging
stories. Others were playing cards. The air was full of
tobacco smoke, stale and close. Rio and Martin went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
to the desk. A jumpy-eyed man behind it knew them
and nodded. Martin took out his book. His dues were
paid to the following month, but he laid down eight more
dollars.</p>

<p>The nervous fellow looked at him, then took the book
and examined it carefully.</p>

<p>“I see you ain’t got in no picket duty since you left
the west coast,” he said.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“We could use a man on the line to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>“Put me down, too,” said Rio. “I need a good sleep.”</p>

<p>“Yeah!” snapped the agent. “This ain’t Frisco, nor
Portland, where they bat their scabby brains out. Here,
the Company takes these fink bastards from the ship by
car and leaves ’em in town. The boys make a few clap
joints, meet the transportation and are brought back to
the ship.” The agent licked his lips, showing perfect
teeth, shining and yellow. “It’s silk—till they sail
under.” He bit a fingernail and turned to another man.</p>

<p>Rio was growling when he and Martin left the Hall.</p>

<p>“God damn the finks,” he said.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Martin. “They struck me midships
once. They nearly sank me.”</p>

<p>“You know,” said Rio, angrily, “I like you. But for
Christ’s sake, don’t give me your end of the sea! You’re
about as salty as lard.”</p>

<p>Martin smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, they nearly sank me,” he repeated. “The ship
was listing fourteen degrees when the bos’n ran into the
fo’c’sle in his dirty underwear. He danced the ise-odori
with a bottle of Saki under one arm and an ordinary
seaman under the other, on a deck that would have frozen
grandmother’s mittens. Now Rio, do you figure yourself
a deep water sailor? Because you’ve pulled in the log
on a cold night and lashed barrels to a hatch with your
butt to the wind—are you sure of the ocean?... Have
you ever curled a sea egg around your elbow?—kissed
a barracuda over black water?—raced a shark in a harbor
full of battle-wagons dumping garbage, with your
own boat forty feet away against the wind? Have you
winked at a sea spider and made him shuffle backwards
till his legs ruffled slow sand in your face?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Rio, laughing, “I told you once you
were the ‘part of.’”</p>

<p>They were back at Pier V7. Other men were concentrating
from the Hall to relieve the day pickets.</p>

<p>“They brought in two cars full,” said a tall fellow
who had been heading the day men. He turned to Rio.
“You take care of the night gang. We’ll bring down
coffee. The Company is usin’ black sedans—some of the
blinds was down when they pulled in. A couple of cops
is standin’ by the gate so you can’t do much there. But
if you divide your gang and send half of ’em up the
alley a ways, you can get a sign. Hop on the runnin’
board, an’ you know what to do. Another thing. All the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
deck officers walked out when we was paid off except
the third mate. That’s one Company man I’d like to see
you get. The finks may not get no leave to-night, but the
<i>Leana</i> don’t sail for four days. If we keep a good lookout,
maybe we can get a couple of the bastards. That’s
all, except don’t do no drinkin’.”</p>

<p>“What’s that on your breath?” asked someone.
“Orange juice?”</p>

<p>“I can hold it,” said the tall fellow.</p>

<p>The pickets laughed and the day men left. The night
gang joined around Rio.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a few of you up there.” Rio pointed to a
pile of dunnage. “The rest of you watch the gate. If a
Company car comes, give me a light three times and
get out. We’ll take care of the rest of it. Don’t talk to
the cops unless they talk to you first. Keep your distance
from the gate. Have you got a torch you can signal me
with, Billy?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t.”</p>

<p>“I got mine here,” said one of the men, pulling out a
flashlight.</p>

<p>“Give it to Billy,” said Rio. “He’s worked with me
before. Remember, Billy—burn it at me three times.”</p>

<p>“O.K.”</p>

<p>It was almost dark and Rio selected his men, including
Martin. They walked up the street to an old pile of
lumber by a dark pier.</p>

<p>“Get this, boys—no knives. A club’s best, but not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
piece of pipe. Work on ’em hard, but don’t kill ’em.
You, Eddy—and you, Martin—an’ me’ll hop the runnin’
board. Smash the glass an’ bring her to the side.
We got to work fast before brass-buttons shows up.”</p>

<p>“What if they’re Company officials?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“<em>They</em> won’t be here,” said Rio, amused. “But if they
are, give ’em two, instead of one.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with ye, sonny?” asked a dwarf-like
man with immense shoulders. “Is yer belly soft?”
He glared at Martin.</p>

<p>“We’ll find out soon, my muscle-bound patriot,” said
Martin walking toward him swiftly.</p>

<p>Several seamen jumped between them.</p>

<p>“I’ll hear one more crack from either of you, an’ I’ll
bat your thick skulls together,” said Rio quietly. “Our
union is split already. We got work to do, an’ you start
a parade. You ain’t fit to work.”</p>

<p>“I’ll work,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said the heavy seaman.</p>

<p>“Shake hands,” said an older man with grizzled hair
and an intense, strained face.</p>

<p>“It was my fault,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Naw, it was mine,” objected the squat fellow sheepishly
as they shook hands.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to kiss,” said Rio sharply. Then he
held up his hand. “Get this straight,” he continued. “It
ain’t no joke we’re playin’. Maybe this’ll help.” He took
a bottle from his pocket and passed it around, each man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
taking a shot of the liquor. Rio finished it and tossed
the bottle under the dunnage. “It’s about time for the
rats to come out if they’re goin’ ashore,” he went on.
“Keep an eye to the pier.” He turned suddenly to one
of the younger seamen. “You ain’t got no club.”</p>

<p>“My brother was killed in Detroit that way, Rio.
Lemme use my fists.”</p>

<p>Rio turned his face aside for a moment. When he
looked at the boy again it was like metal.</p>

<p>“Get yourself a club, buddy.”</p>

<p>Hesitatingly, the seaman took up a knotty piece of
wood. He held it in his hands one way and then another,
his face white.</p>

<p>One of the men came up to Rio and took him to one
side. He said something in a low voice and Rio nodded.
The man returned his nod and left hurriedly.</p>

<p>“<i>This is the time, dear Mother</i>—” hummed a seaman.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said his partner.</p>

<p>They waited silently, watching the pier for any light.
Suddenly, a man came upon them, startling them as he
shuffled in and laid down a large package.</p>

<p>“Here it is, Rio.” The man was panting. “It’s me—Al.”</p>

<p>“Beer!” The men exulted quietly, peering through the
early darkness.</p>

<p>Al now took a short automatic from his pocket and
handed it to Rio.</p>

<p>“Drink up,” Rio said to the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span></p>

<p>Each man took a bottle and waited in turn for the
opener except one seaman who, impatient, knocked off
the cap of his bottle against a block of wood.</p>

<p>“Take the rest down to the men at the pier,” said Rio
to Al, who shambled away noiselessly.</p>

<p>Someone struck a match. In the flare Rio saw Martin
regarding him steadily. He grinned. It was a painful,
smashing look and he didn’t take his eyes away. The
match flickered out and Martin came up to him slowly.</p>

<p>“Watch for the lights, Eddy,” cautioned Rio, as he
and Martin walked a few yards away from the lowered
sounds of the men.</p>

<p>“So you believe, Martin, that I’d pull this?” Rio
twisted the automatic in his hand. “Al got this for me.
He’d eat out of my hand. Never mind why. This—belongs
to Roberts. It was used one night. I got it for you.”</p>

<p>“You told the story?” asked Martin.</p>

<p>“I told no story. Al’s a thief. He does what I say, but
his heart is finer than yours.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” said Martin, feeling the gun and
Rio’s hands in the dark. Breaking it under Rio’s wrist,
he suddenly threw back his arm and spun the automatic
into the river.... Vaguely he heard Rio say there
were lights....</p>

<p>Martin looked toward the pier and saw the headlights
of an automobile coming upon them. The car was gaining
speed as it passed the pile of lumber. Martin, faster
than the others, leaped for the running board and swung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
himself against the windshield glass, holding to the door-handle.
His head was turned just enough to see Eddy
jump behind him. Eddy missed the board. His body spun
vertically against the rear fender and crashed on the
pavement. Behind him, Rio was running frantically.
Martin smashed his hand through the side window, feeling
slivers of glass against his arm. He caught the driver
by the throat and, through the sound of the motor, could
hear the dark gurgle under his fingers. There was swearing
and shoving inside, but Martin hurt too much to care.
He pushed steadily against the lower part of the wheel
until the machine swerved and tilted toward the river.
It came around in a wide arc, breaking heavily on the
shoulder of the pier. Then Martin heard Rio’s voice and
knew that he, himself, was falling. He turned so that
the back of his head would not strike the paving, and
felt the rush of hot blood as his nose and mouth hit first.
Instead of putting him out, it cleared his brain. He lay
quietly, watching Rio swing his fist and then his club.
Abstractly, he watched the other men in the crew go into
action against the finks. He didn’t care....</p>

<p>The gorilla-like sailor with whom he had quarreled,
held a bottle as though it were a club. He was snarling
as he pulled a man from the car.</p>

<p>“So it <em>is</em> ye, ye finkified mate! I been lookin for ye!”
Martin heard him say. “I been lookin’ for ye, an’ yer
damned long finger ye’ve pointed at me like a dog! God!—I’ll
git that finger now!” he added hoarsely, bringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
the bottle down on the fender of the car until it was
split across. Savagely he threw the mate on the ground,
held him by the collar and stepped on his wrist. Then,
separating the man’s forefinger from the rest of his
hand, he brought down the split edge of the bottle sharply
above the middle knuckle.</p>

<p>“Wife—Wife!” cried the mate softly.</p>

<p>The seaman picked up the severed finger, shook it in
the man’s face and flung it on the ground beside him.</p>

<p>“Splice it, Jack! Splice it!” He was cursing the fallen
man brokenly. Martin looked away....</p>

<p>Then he saw the boy whose brother had been killed in
Detroit. “Automobiles,” thought Martin. The boy had
no club and was on his back, fighting desperately with a
large man from the car. Martin crawled to his knees, not
feeling his injured arm or his split chin. He stood waveringly
for a moment and got to them just as the man’s
broad hand was spearing the boy’s face. Martin knew
that he was falling again, not fighting, as he reached
them; but he dug his teeth into a fleshy neck and held
on as though he were killing a snake, while the body beneath
him thrashed and cried. A hard hand pulled him
off. Rio was standing above him.</p>

<p>“It’s over, Martin. We got a car.... Come, men!”</p>

<p>Martin spat out blood and climbed into the automobile
along with the others.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXVIII</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin went slowly to Roberts’ apartment house,
his head lowered. His right arm was in a sling, the lower
part of his mouth was bruised and split. His nose was
swollen. He went up in the elevator to Roberts’ rooms
and rang once. A doctor came out into the hall. For a
moment the two men regarded each other speculatively.
Martin saw the blue, introspective eyes, the strong turn
of the chin and the gray hairline, receding deeply at
the temples. The physician saw a young man with a
broken, illusive face.</p>

<p>“I’m Martin Devaud, Doctor. I’m Roberts’ friend. I
heard he asked for me.”</p>

<p>“I can see you, Martin,” said the physician kindly,
“for I’m Roberts’ friend, too.”</p>

<p>Martin rubbed his cut arm and turned his eyes away.</p>

<p>“You can see? How far?”</p>

<p>The physician shook his head, but did not answer.</p>

<p>“This stroke,” Martin continued. “Is it serious? Is
there any time to help?”</p>

<p>All this while, the doctor had been watching him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
noticing his bruised face and strained expression, his
bandaged arm.</p>

<p>“You seem to have been in something of a mix-up,
yourself,” the physician smiled faintly. Then, of a sudden,
his face became divisible with the old, tired pains
and the new, sharp ones as balance. “Do you know Roberts’
condition?” he asked seriously.</p>

<p>“No,” said Martin. “Roberts and I quarreled, and I
haven’t seen him lately.” He ran his hand over his tender
chin.</p>

<p>The doctor looked off down the hall, and in his eyes
there was now restraint born of his intimacy with pain.</p>

<p>“He mentions your name continually, Martin,” observed
the physician. “The thought of you seems to make
him desperate in the moments of lucidity which unfortunately
attend his madness. And from the strange way
he talks at times, one might think you had had a part
in the cause of this grave illness. But such is not the case.
His illness took root years ago.”</p>

<p>One word cried out to Martin.</p>

<p>“‘Madness’?—you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the physician. “It’s like the putrefaction
of albumen. Almost like the expansion of gasses within
a closed chamber. This disintegration must go on. It’s
what we have here.”</p>

<p>Martin felt himself turning sick.</p>

<p>“‘Putrefaction’? Doctor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. Putrefaction of the cerebral mass, that most
delicate and most amazing structure—a powerful gift to
man.” The doctor was grave.</p>

<p>“What can I do?” asked Martin, horrified.</p>

<p>In answer, the physician shook his head and Martin
knew that all was futile.</p>

<p>“May I see him?”</p>

<p>Again the doctor regarded Martin thoughtfully. It
was as though he wondered whether this man’s agitated
mind could view the spectacle which was soon to be
presented. And Martin, waiting quietly, understood and
respected this professional skepticism. At last, the physician
spoke.</p>

<p>“Before you go in, Martin, remember that you are
looking at the demanding, expansive form of paresis.
Be careful!”</p>

<p>As Martin entered the bedroom he saw a disorientated
face—a deflective rapport of Roberts with his environment—a
clouding of consciousness. And as he went
closer he knew that Roberts had no comprehension of
detail or of situation. Martin felt completely helpless.
It seemed to him that the translucent, attenuated skeleton
of the adviser had wrapped its arms around him,
instead of the disease. The sick man’s lips, dry and split,
opened and closed in an effort to speak. The guttural
tones reached Martin’s ears as though from a great
distance—the words moving gently, like a broad leaf
without wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span></p>

<p>“Martin! Martin!” Roberts’ expression became clear
and defined. The immobile muscles of his face relaxed.
“Martin!” he repeated. “Are you there?”</p>

<p>In the room was a terrible pressure.</p>

<p>Again he called—“Martin! Martin! Are you there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Roberts, I’m here.”</p>

<p>The pitiful, decayed mask upon the pillow broke like
a free tide. It spilled in diluted, semi-conscious tears
against the linen. Roberts tried to shake the covers; but
his hands stood out perpendicularly from the sides of
his waist. They remained there, insensitive, incoherent,
until Martin took them gently and laid them on the sheet.</p>

<p>Again, momentary consciousness lighted Roberts’
face. Its brightness and shrewd study shocked Martin
more than any act of tension could have done.</p>

<p>“Do you want a confession, dear boy?” called out
the sick man. “Do you want my signature?... Ha, ha!—Ho,
ho!—Hee, hee, hee!...” The ghastly cry reflected
from the ceiling. It wasn’t laughter, or hysteria.
It was a lachrymose and untidily folded cry of remorse,
torn from the swiftly hollowing brain cell.</p>

<p>With his left hand Martin raised his own wounded
arm to his forehead. When at last he brought it down,
the gauze was wet. In the interim, bright eyes shone
through the window. They were mirthful, smoldering
and amused—the cancerous eyes of birds. Infuriated,
Martin crossed the room and pulled down the blinds.
When he turned in the direction of the bed once more,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
Roberts’ luminous eyes were parallel with his hand
which was now hanging over the edge of the covers. The
constriction of the pupils was so intense—so minute that
the eyes seemed blind. But the expression was one of
gravest interest.</p>

<p>“Come, Martin! Come, Infidelity! You’re my only
one. If I don’t look grotesque enough for a death scene,
give me a nightcap. One with white flaps over the ears
and a blue peak—laugh for me, Martin!”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, Roberts—not now. I’m dying with
you.”</p>

<p>There was a sprawling, unintelligible sound from the
adviser’s lips, and then silence. Martin waited, amazed
at the clarity of Roberts’ words, amazed at this strange
and powerful mind, still formidable. Again the adviser
looked at him.</p>

<p>“Die?” he asked peevishly. Then more firmly, “No
you won’t, darling. Unhappy men don’t die.... Could
you give me your strong, brown arm without shuddering?
It would mean a great deal to me.... I can see
your strong, brown arm where there’s heat and dark,
flashing clouds. It’s peeling a tangerine—cutting a fruit
for lips as soft as the flesh in my spine—oh, wicked!...
A dark girl’s belly—the cup for your mouth. Oh,
God, Martin! Your mouth—the stomach—the stench of
normalcy. Before that happens, give me your arm—your
clean, brown arm....”</p>

<p>Martin went swiftly to the bed, his eyes flickering as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
he sank to his knees. With his good left arm, and hiding
the one stripped with bandages, he lifted the skull-like
head until it was level with his own, which had begun
to throb and ache.</p>

<p>“Here is my arm, Roberts. It is your protection and
your faith,” he said.</p>

<p>Vapidly Roberts smiled at him.</p>

<p>“My faith—my own true faith.... No one believed,
but I knew that you were mine!... Not even Deane
believed.”</p>

<p>“Not even Deane,” repeated Martin, his wounded arm
shaking against the silken counterpane.</p>

<p>Roberts’ eyes were becoming glazed.</p>

<p>“They’d all feel cheap, if they could see us now.
Your arms around a corpse—a corpse that strikes to
prove itself!” His thin hand pushed against Martin’s
broken nose, falling again and again on Martin’s face
which failed to recognize the pain. “You love me, though
I’m defeated, my dear boy.” He raised his hand once
more, but this time it dropped limply to the coverlet.
Again the torn brain lost all contact, and he wandered,
hesitantly.</p>

<p>“I come before the leisured policies of man. I have
these tears, these positive notes of cruelty. Do you want
to know?... Smash the hidden casket of Carol, and
you’ll find the first. He fed himself with the intolerable
dreams of your isolated sanctuary. He cried out of lips
as stale as mine. Our Grail was the same, each futile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
in its own pride. Carol, the bucket. Filled with the residue
of my hatred. Murder?—Death?—That’s nothing....
I went to him on a night gray as your eyes. He
desired you. His flesh, quite frantically, cried out. Could
I stand <em>that</em>? Could I stand the corned stupidity of his
mind after <em>you</em>, most beautiful?... I went to him.
Deadly and most honestly I threw the passionate, leaden
stone into the vacuum of his heart.” Roberts spoke without
lips—the ventriloquy of his despair so hurtful and
adolescent, so pitifully gay.</p>

<p>“There is a tear for Rio. I’ve seen him follow you with
his eyes—that rollicking, healthy sailor! That bold adventurer
with the Mongoloid eyes. His bravado is covered
with a native strength to hide his shame.” Roberts
chuckled hoarsely. “My sinful innocent—never to have
seen the colored lechery behind his muscles!... Rio—epitome
of flesh—carnality in Mother Goose’s shoes—a
bundle of white snow—quite terrified.... I’ve
seen his bleak face, whipped by wind and wave, and so
have you. But it takes death to bring me the knowledge
of his simple, frightened passion. Oh!—he will never
fail you, although he doesn’t know why.... Enough
of him—enough of his cautious, boastful gallantry
which makes one sick when one is well, and makes one
laugh when one is sick.” Again the adviser hesitated.
Slowly and painfully he turned that he might look at
Martin.</p>

<p>“The next tear is for Deane—the one you think you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
own. You don’t possess her. You hold an empty vase—the
artificial movements, smiles and anguish of the
woman—all of them as brazen as I, when I first met you.
I thought you were the spindle, I the thread. I thought
that you were life—an intoxicating bubble in a heavily
filled glass. Deeply and amusedly I drank, too late to
feel the poison.”</p>

<p>“I’ve saved a tear for Drew. He thought that he was
strong enough to escape. But it isn’t ‘escape’ to avoid
the thing one loves the most. And so, <em>I</em> know I had the
strength <em>not</em> to escape—and I am happier than he....</p>

<p>“The last tear is in a vial that I give you. A tear to use
when abstract sorrow’s not enough—a potion you may
pour on blistered flesh to lift the crust of tender skin that
each swift-moving piston and fast-spinning wheel of man
can drive and curve before your fond excitement.</p>

<p>“On myself, you didn’t use a tear. Your hands and
mind tore my integument until the bone shows. Watch
this!” Roberts, weakened, but fierce, reached for Martin’s
hair. There was a brief silence as Martin, his head
bowed over the bed, felt the momentary spasm of twisted
fingers on his scalp. He did not speak or lift his eyes.
As in a dream, he felt the fingers that had clutched his
hair so frightfully, become more feeble. There was a
gentle, automatic patting against his forehead and he
heard deep, horrible sobs....</p>

<p>Roberts put his hands across his eyes.</p>

<p>“Martin, you are like my desperate, dead mother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
she being the more selfish and adored though, of the
two. It’s why I’ve loved you both, though you the less.
She is the most important now. She is the greater.” The
adviser raised his head in a final gesture of triumph.
“Speak! Why don’t you speak, Martin? Your tongue’s
been loose enough before. But now that each mad syllable
could match the inarticulation in my own vast
lungs, you sit dumbly—like a passive Christ. Have you
reformed?—or, are you a dead man waiting for my
company? For I’m a King. I have great powers. Shall
I have you tortured in my dungeons, or thrown from my
domain?—But no! I have no rack, no bed of agony to
meet your own inventions. And my domain’s a joke. You
own it all, from the boiling center of the earth unto the
farthest, coldest star.”</p>

<p>Martin held him closer. He stared at Roberts until the
sick man’s eyelids lifted, showing the brief, unfocused
glance. There was recognition, but complete indifference.
The vacant, polite smile was only a slight movement of
the lips. Had Martin not been blinded by his own fine
helplessness—his deepened affection, he would have seen
another thing. He would have noticed the oddly rounded
chin with its slackness—its hint of cogent lechery below
the hungry bones that stretched the cheek of the adviser.
He would have seen the newly tapered lines, out of silhouette,
and the dense eyes, gaping; or the fibrous hair,
the cocked head and gently fluttering tongue. Instead,
the generalities—vague outlines were predominant. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
swiftly perishing mask, to Martin’s eyes, could have been
a sallow apple—a melon broken from the vine—or an
older moon in autumn. There was no individuality or
ego. There were damp breathings, sonorous emanations
from the bed and the faint, orgastic music of white
flowers in a tomb. Martin held his breath, held his own
head lower and asked for some release.... When he
looked up again this blended, spectral motion was gone
forever. This mixture of sound and color, so horrible to
him, now drifted from the gently closing door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXIX</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin knew that it was time to work again. He
knew that there must be some expression of his own
to erase the unending march of Carol and Roberts in his
thoughts. The evolution of his type design had stopped,
each pattern seeming worse than the preceding one.</p>

<p>He was disturbed and hesitant upon regarding the
sun. The clouds were no longer poems and the sunset
meant only darkness. Within himself alone could he feel
the yearnings and the beauty, the life chord pulling, insisting.
He was tormented with dreams. Sounds grew
from the ground. Proud women with dragons on their
white shoulders walked in a death-like mist. Behind the
retreating curve of mountain he could hear Deane laughing.
Brought with the wind, the laughter became monotonous—something
at which to strike.</p>

<p>In the early morning there was peace. In the early
morning when even the birds were silent and the stars
white, Martin would awaken and stand by the window.
During these moments he was elated and alive. But
when he went to sleep again, he fought among dreams
that seemed both real and unreal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span></p>

<p>One daybreak he awoke and threw his arm across his
eyes. The night’s monsters were growing larger and
more demanding. Perhaps it was impossible to kill them
by bending them into symbols—by throwing them on
paper. The units of the living and the dead must be presented
to daytime and the mind’s curiosity. He worked
soberly, breeding the straight line with the afflicted. He
tried the medium of words, changing every character,
crossing their susceptible hands. He danced the ugly
noises with the sound of roses and blew a splintering
rock into a wreath of silver hair. Bravely he went to the
night’s agony and blinding sweat until he felt himself
confused by so meaningless a gallantry that once again
he turned to Deane.</p>

<p>They sat beside each other in her home that night.
Deane saw that he had changed—she saw his quietude,
the patient line between his eyes.</p>

<p>He kissed her lips.</p>

<p>“It’s restful here, darling,” he said. “A sweet, domestic
anodyne—the sweetest I have ever known. The transition
has been swift. I ran with wild men, smashed
machines, climbed, waded and struggled toward an impossible
ideal. I was hard when Carol was murdered;
and though little chips were broken from me, the planets
remained in their orbits—heat meant one thing, and cold
another. This is still true in one sense; but my relationship
to them has changed.... Roberts died in my
arms. He thought I loved him. Diseased, humiliated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
our artificial sexual codes, he made his own world. Quite
happily he lived and dreamed in this chimerical condition
until unfortunately, I entered his last kingdom. It
had to be myself—the one man whose bitter defenses
remained impregnable to Roberts’ bold demands. However,
as the albinic, antagonistic germ bored into his
brain, this mind became detached, severed; and I felt
the pent-up hatred of his frustration. I didn’t mind that—but
suddenly, consciousness was established again
through some strange medium, and he told me it was
my world—that he belonged to me. He told me of my
cruelty. And that’s how he died.... I love you, Deane,
but I’ll go back to the midstrip of the world where my
toes bubble, oiling the hot deck of a ship, before I’ll hurt
you. That’s my country—isolation in body, but not in
mind. And when I touch land it will be a dark whore.”
Martin’s face had not changed expression nor had his
voice gathered volume. But his self-contempt and his
visualizations against the soft, purple shadows of the
quiet room and the chained refractions of the woman’s
beautiful face beside him pressed Heaven and Hell together
and there was no breath around them.</p>

<p>Deane held back her tears.</p>

<p>“You’re bleeding yourself, Martin,” she said, “and
for no reason. I’m in love with you, too, and I love your
fantasies. But please don’t talk of things which are absurd—of
the South Seas—of dirty ships and dirtier
islands. Your sound effects about black women are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
dramatic, darling—they’re just a little irrational. Oh,
no!—Martin, I’m not trusting your libido or your discrimination.
To be candid, it isn’t a question of trust.
You must have your stage, your setting and your actors.
I don’t mind that—and I’ll be part of the whole scheme
although I don’t understand it. I’ve run wild, too, though
in a different way. But I found out how meaningless it
was, how much it hurt me without helping anyone else
and I’ve stopped, just as you’ll do. There will always be
violence in your dreams, and that will be some outlet.
And there are gymnasiums and little fishing boats where
you can break your neck in a more restrained fashion.”
Deane closed her hands on his, and spoke with a desperate
gravity. “And you can always swear loudly to me
about the world’s tyranny—perhaps I’ll swear a little,
also. But you can’t go back to bad ships and worse men,
and be part of an organized brutality. I want you here
with me. I want you to work on your beautiful ideas and
build a solid foundation for both of us. You look different,
Martin. You look more mature. I think you’re tired
of that other world. Dearest,” she went on, touching her
lips to his cheek, “we can’t dismiss our life together
even though it has been brief.” She turned to Martin
with a sudden passionate insistence. “Let’s go on from
this point together, darling. Let’s dismiss philosophy,
ideals that can be forgotten in a night, other people’s
helplessness and drama.” She held Martin more tightly.
“We must stop thinking about these terrible people,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
she repeated. “What do we care about them?” Deane’s
lips trembled. “Carnality!” she exclaimed. “The vile,
damnable beasts! Pouncing from house to house and bedroom
to bedroom like a disjointed Roman carnival. Give
them any veil of understanding you possess and they
still exist in the flatlands—the tilted, undernoted lowlands
where not even slime comes to birth! A driveling
code of introduction from one land to the other and a
rotten horde of Young America comes alive! What have
we to do with that?” Deane was weeping; and as though
symbolical of her blazing words, her hair had spread
over her shoulders—had spread, thought Martin as he
touched it, “like the flame of a torch in the dark waters
of a lost lagoon.”</p>

<p>“‘What have we to do with that?’” he repeated.
“Nothing, Deane. Nothing can touch us now. But first
I have to go from you. I don’t know for how long, or
how far. It’s part of the scheme. And remember, I didn’t
build it; but I know the undertows, the ebb tides and
the breakers. There is a distant sun on our horizon, and
I won’t go into happiness or unhappiness until it’s
reached. Don’t you think I’ll miss those lights?” He
pointed out of the window. “But I’ll have stars around
that will bring this room to me. I’m a dreamer, and they
have luck. So forget the dull months or the aching ones.
Give my picture a bath once a day until it’s white; and
I’ll stay that way.” Martin’s voice broke and he stood
up. “I can’t say ‘Good-bye, Mrs. Smith—’ and bow and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
strain until my sharp, black coat sticks out, nor turn and
smile ‘It’s been a pleasant afternoon—I’ll call you
soon.’”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> His voice became harsh. “These fools’ farewells
and wet good-byes are as thick and viscous as a
glue pot, Deane. Sentiment rises in me easily and I’m
ashamed that my hand seems blurred against the dress
that covers your knee. That’s why I curse such weakness
and yearn to leave my beloved with my hat over my nose,
yelling blasphemously at a wall-eyed, pot-bellied moon.”</p>

<p>“You sound like a drunken Irish tenor,” exclaimed
Deane, covering her celibate pain at once with the same
quick irony.</p>

<p>“By God, I <em>am</em> drunk!” cried Martin. “Drunk on your
hair and the moisture of your lips and the way you look
at me. Drunk with hatred because I won’t see them or
taste them again until the same dark wind that takes me
away brings me back.”</p>

<p>A wraith-like smile hovered on Deane’s lips.</p>

<p>“The wind that brings you home, Martin, won’t be
dark. It will be light and gentle and perhaps will carry
a few white clouds on its back.”</p>

<p>“No.” He shook his head. “I want it dark and heavy
and raging. I want it so fierce it will bring me home
much faster.”</p>

<p>“Let me have it my way, Martin,” she urged softly.
“I want it gentle so that no part of you will be hurt.
I’ve never been patient about most things; but I will be—about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
this.” Deane spoke so tenderly that the cool
night wind stopped blowing, and a moment of such stillness
ensued that all outside was hidden—all sound, all
waves of sound and color—everything was hidden.</p>

<p>“Almighty God!” whispered Martin, staring at her—staring
at her coral cheeks and swollen bosom. “The
Scylla Deeps—a sea no man has found—” Aloud he
cried, “It will be done your way, Deane. In the end, it
will always be your way.” The tears were coming into
his eyes without restraint. He opened the door, saw the
silhouette of the woman sitting quietly on the couch,
looked for a moment through the window at the lights
which seemed to be nodding to him and went into the
hall.</p>

<p>Outside, in the street, he hesitated, then turned toward
the river. For a long time he wandered about the
waterfront. Wearily, at last, he sat down on one of the
piers and watched the moon set. When dawn came he
got up stiffly and went to the Seaman’s Institute.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>CHAPTER XXX</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Martin went into the large main room of the Institute,
found a vacant chair, sat down and looked at the
men. He couldn’t recognize a single face although the
seamen were going through the usual formulas. Some
of them were lined up before the marble bar, drinking
coffee and eating doughnuts. Others stood in groups,
talking to each other; while a few, like himself, sat
quietly, knowing themselves on the fringe of the stream.
Some of these few were regarding their history—pressing
their falls and errors out of the past. Some were
rubbing the small change in their pockets, wondering
whether to buy “smoke” and for a brief period drift into
the senseless drunkenness and blindness of the poison,
or to try again—to use this precious remnant of their
money for getting to a pier already lined with men as
desperate to ship out as themselves.</p>

<p>A man walked in, brown-skinned, alert. He went, in
turn, to several groups of seamen. They welcomed him
and he shook their hands. “I wonder how long he’ll
last,” thought Martin. “A week, I guess, if he’s paid
off.” He heard the men question the newcomer about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
ship—the food. Had he seen Ella in Coconut Grove?...
Was Charlie’s Punch Bowl as alive as ever?...
Had he paid off?... The man grinned when they mentioned
Ella, nodded his head vigorously about Jamaica;
but said “No!” about paying off.</p>

<p>“I can’t get that way again, boys.” He pointed to a
few deadheads, snoring in their chairs. His finger swung
to Martin. “For Christ’s sake,” he said, walking rapidly
to him. For a moment he stood in front of him, shaking
his head, his hands on his hips. “You look like one of
them crawlers we used to swat in Morocco. Is your short-arm
jammed?”</p>

<p>Martin managed a thin smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve spent a winter in New York—that’s all.”</p>

<p>The sailor bent over him.</p>

<p>“Listen—I been up at the Hall. I heard what you
done the other night. There’s two ships in you can make.
One is your old pal, the <i>Verda</i>. We need two men. Can
you get Rio? I still got his oilskins.”</p>

<p>“What happened to the little ordinary, Al?” Martin
asked.</p>

<p>The sailor looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“The ordinary?” Al thought a moment. “Oh—you
mean that little screw that was aboard when you and
Rio piled off. Damned if I know. He only made one
more trip. Say,” he said, looking at Martin queerly, “we
sail at five. There ain’t no time to lose. Git hold of Rio
and beat it to the Hall.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Martin, getting up. He went out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
quickly, nodding to the policeman by the entrance, then
hurried to Rio’s room and knocked on the door. Rio
opened it. He looked half-asleep.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he asked, rolling back on the bed.
“James don’t bring coffee till eleven.”</p>

<p>“I’m shipping on the <i>Verda</i> this evening. Do you
want to come along?”</p>

<p>“Nuts again, eh?” said Rio, yawning.</p>

<p>Martin turned to go.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” called Rio, sitting up. “How do you
know we can make her?”</p>

<p>“We’re the fair-haired boys after the other night. Al
told me about the ship. But we have to hurry.”</p>

<p>“Are you leavin’ Deane?” asked Rio incredulously.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me that,” said Martin, his face turning
white.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want the damned <i>Verda</i>. I’m going to
Santa de Marina.”</p>

<p>“Rio,” Martin opened the door, “this is the last trip
we can ever make together. I don’t want the <i>Verda</i> either,
but she’ll get me to Panama. From there I can make it
to the East Indies. And as far as Santa de Marina is concerned,
the <i>Verda</i> goes to Puerto Colombia. You can
swim from that point.”</p>

<p>Without a word Rio got up and began to put on his
clothes. His bag was packed and Martin didn’t ask him
why. When he was dressed they went to the Hall and
saw the agent again. This time he greeted them more
cordially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span></p>

<p>“I was hopin’ you boys would come. That was great
stuff,” he said, looking significantly at the end of his
own nose. “You earned this jelly.” He made out two
forms for the mate of the <i>Verda</i> and gave them to Martin
and Rio. “Get there by three P.M. drunk or sober.”
One of his eyes twitched nervously.</p>

<p>“O.K.,” said Rio.</p>

<p>He and Martin put their slips in their pockets and left
the Hall.</p>

<p>“Is your gear ready, Martin?”</p>

<p>“It won’t take long. But I have a note to write, so we’ll
make it fast.”</p>

<p>Once in his room, Martin packed his clothes with
Rio’s help, saw that his sneakers were rotten and threw
them away. Then he sat down at his desk, folded his
drawings and put them in an envelope addressed <span class="allsmcap">MRS.
IDARA</span>. For a few moments he sat there, staring at the
name, a shameless grief upon his face. After a little, he
took a piece of paper and a pen and wrote:</p>

<p>“Dearest....”</p>

<p>Rio walked up and down, smoking one cigarette after
another, stopping at intervals to glance somewhat anxiously
at Martin.</p>

<p>When Martin finally got up, his eyes were red; but he
looked straight at Rio.</p>

<p>“That’s that, my bonny friend. We’re going to the
<i>Verda</i>.”</p>

<p class="tb">On the deck of the <i>Verda</i> they found the mate. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
looked at the papers sent from the Hall and at the men’s
discharges and lifeboat tickets.</p>

<p>“You can take the eight to twelve, Martin. And you,
Rio, the four to eight. The bos’n won’t mind. He’s sleeping
some of it off. We sail at five and if you go ashore,
for God’s sake don’t get too drunk. Somebody has to
handle those derricks. Al and Pete’s ashore, and the
ordinaries came from Mr. Fizz in the office. They won’t
know a block from a winch.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going ashore,” said Martin.</p>

<p>“Me neither,” said Rio.</p>

<p>The mate looked at them in some astonishment as
they went aft. Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>It was like all ships at sailing time. The sailors cursed
the lines and the mates cursed the sailors. The ordinaries
didn’t know what to do, but they hopped gallantly from
one side of the deck to the other in a cold sweat of pretense.
Pete’s arm was nearly pulled from its socket when
Al gave the winch too much steam. A linesman on the
dock shook his fist at the ship and the captain walked
up and down the bridge, saying little, but looking at his
watch frequently. A longshoreman got his finger caught,
working at one end of the hatch, and yelled frantically in
Italian.... But finally it was done, as it is, always.
And the <i>Verda</i> backed into the current with a tugboat
pushing against an impossible weight and barking angrily
through her whistle. It was almost eight when the
last hatch had been battened and the lines coiled. Martin
went back to the fo’c’sle and washed his hands and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
face. Then he rubbed his back and chest, put on a clean
shirt and was on the ladder to the bridge in time to hear
eight bells struck.</p>

<p class="tb">Martin grew into the relativity of time. Was it a day?—a
month?—a year that he had been in these warm
waters?... The stars grew deeper in the night; the
constellations spread their tails above the ship; the moon,
more arrogant than ever, called from the sky and filled
his eyes with dust. It was the same. The dark, fast knife
of cloud that ran at him was welcomed as a friend. This
monster might blot out, in mercy, the silhouette of
Deane.... When pressure, rain and cracked, dry
lightning burned his eyes, he held his hands—his arms
into the wind, that it might bring him solitude from
dreams.... And when the squall had passed he turned
to Rio.</p>

<p>“That entity was beautiful and clean. It swept out all
the clammy, dirty things.... You see that cloud?”
He pointed to the swift, retreating sky. “It had more
tears in one brief moment, Rio, than both you, and I,
and all our comrades in a lifetime. And once again,
when life is sticky—seminant with lies, we’ll find a ship,
and find that cloud and hold it....”</p>

<p>Rio sighed.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
